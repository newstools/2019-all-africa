Dar es Salaam â€” United Bank for Africa (UBA) Tanzania managing director Usman Imam Isiaka says the bank group is confident about the construction of the $2.95 billion (Sh6.6 trillion) Rufiji Hydropower Project. Mr Isiaka said the over-2000MW project was a significant investment for Tanzania, which would be a major milestone in the power generation sector. He said UBA Bank was proud to be associated with the country's desire for the completion of the dam at what is commonly known as 'Stiegler's Gorge' along the Rufiji river. He was speaking during a visit to Mwananchi Communications Limited (MCL) offices at Tabata Relini, Dar es Salaam, yesterday. Mr Isiaka said the energy sector was among the main areas of financing for the Nigeria-headquartered UBA Group. So far, UBA Tanzania and CRDB Bank Tanzania have provided Advanced Payment Guarantees (APG) of $516 million to JV partners (Arab Contractors and Elsewedy Electric of Egypt) on the back of a counter-guarantee provided by the Africa Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) of Egypt for the project. The guarantee was followed by disbursement of $309 million (Sh710 billion) of the foreign component of the APG by Tanzania Electric Supply Company (Tanesco).
