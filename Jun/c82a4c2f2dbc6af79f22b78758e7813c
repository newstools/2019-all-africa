He thanked Prime Minister Trudeau for Canada's role in the successful hosting of the Sustainable Blue Economy held in Nairobi in November last year. "Let me also take this opportunity to thank you and your government for the technical and financial support accorded to Kenya during Sustainable Blue Economy Conference," said President Kenyatta.
