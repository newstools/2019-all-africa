The letter, dated 29 March 2019, addressed to ZPC acting manager, Zuwaracho Chikuri and signed by the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Praz) chief executive, Nyasha Chizu details how the power company had subverted public procurement regulations by not performing due diligence on prices set by its supplier. GEC Zimbabwe, one of ZPC's suppliers hiked fees for maintenance of Hwange Power Station's Unit 4 to US$2,205,306.95 from US$808,580.15 charged for Unit 3. The scope of works in both instances were reportedly similar.
