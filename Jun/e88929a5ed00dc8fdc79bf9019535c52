Big Brother Africa, actor and media personality, Uti Nwachukwu has taken to his Instagram to declare Cynthia Nwadiora better known as Cee-C as the most successful housemate of the 2018 edition of Big Brother Naija. According to Nwachukwu, Cee-C has continued to receive massive support since leaving the show and she has proven him right when he declared that there are always two winners in Big Brother, the winner of the grand prize and the one that beats the odds.
