If you rank among the best, you'll win prizes... otherwise, well, you'll sure have a lot of fun. If you're not familiar with this kind of game, it's very simple: you have a budget of 100M to pick a squad of 15 players, with a maximum of 3 from the same team. Player's prices are defined by their quality and their team's strength and then you will earn more or less points according to the player's performance in real life. To better understand all the rules, nothing like trying and playing for yourself. You can also check all the stories they publish at medium.com/the-call-up and check all the fan made youtube videos about RealFevr. RealFevr is a Portuguese company and they have the official Portuguese League fantasy, Liga NOS Virtual, but there are other competitions you can play at RealFevr: Italian League, Brazilian League, Champions League, Europa League and Copa Libertadores.
