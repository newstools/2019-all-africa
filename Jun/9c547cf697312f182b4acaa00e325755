A family in Westville, Durban had an unexpected visitor earlier this month. The family was shocked to find that a 2.3m black mamba had made itself comfortable right outside their front door. Nick Evans, owner of KwaZulu-Natal Amphibian and Reptile Conservation, was quickly summoned and by the time he arrived, the snake had slithered between tiles stacked in a pile outside. It took the 25-year-old almost 10 minutes to catch it. Once captured, Evans microchipped the reptile and released it. Source: News24
