The Ministry of Health of Somalia has announced 133 new suspected cases of cholera, with no deaths, for week 22 (27 May to 2 June) in 2019. No suspected cholera cases were reported between epidemiological weeks 1 and 7 due to closure of main cholera treatment center, from which the data is collected. The cumulative total number of suspected cholera cases since the beginning of this outbreak in December 2017 is 7501, including 46 associated death cases. During this reporting period, cases were reported from 17 districts in Banadir region. 77% of cases (102) are children below 5 years of age. The cholera outbreak has been contained in the districts of Jubaland, Hirshabelle and South West States following implementation of oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaigns and other health interventions. However, active transmission is still reported in Banadir region. Dry weather conditions in Banadir have reduced access to safe water and proper sanitation, which has led to an increase of cholera cases - from 78 in week 21 to 133 in week 22, in 13 of Banadir's 17 districts. Since the beginning of 2019, 186 stool samples have been collected and tested in the National Public Heatlh Laboratory in Mogadishu. During this reporting period, 14 cases were confirmed for Vibrio cholerae, serotype O1 Ogawa, by culture. WHO continues to provide leadership and support the health authorities and partners in activities to mitigate the outbreak. The disease surveillance system is managed by the electronic Early Warning Alert and Response Network (eEWARN) system with the support of WHO and is currently being expanded to all health facilities across the country. WHO and the Ministry of Health continue to monitor outbreak trends through the eEWARN system and promptly investigate and respond to all alerts.
