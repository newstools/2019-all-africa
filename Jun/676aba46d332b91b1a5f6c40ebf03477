Women around the world have an essential role in conflict prevention and resolution, security provision, peace processes, and countering terrorism. For over a decade, the United States has been a leader in promoting global peace and stability by empowering women to take on those roles and addressing challenges faced by women and girls in conflict and disaster affected areas. Today, the United States reaffirms our leadership on these issues with President Trump’s release of the U.S. Strategy on Women, Peace, and Security. The strategy directs the Department of State to ensure women and girls’ meaningful participation and safety in efforts to promote stable and lasting peace as well as enhance U.S. partners’ capacity to advance women, peace, and security. We are proud to take on this task in partnership with the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The Department of State will mobilize the unique contributions of American diplomacy through the implementation of this strategy. The United States recognizes that societies which empower women economically and politically are more stable and peaceful. As such, the strategy is a government-wide effort, complementing the recently announced Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative. Both efforts underscore President Trump’s emphasis on the importance of empowering women to participate fully in civic and economic life, leading to more peaceful and prosperous societies.
