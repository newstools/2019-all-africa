After his arrest, Ringtone updated his fans on social media of his predicament. BROKEN ENGLISH Although he was posting to notify people of his arrest, what caught the attention of the netizen was his broken English. "Its like they arrested your English as well," @kamwash254 tweeted. "I believe its a case of mistaken identity, they should have arrested your English," commented @that_guy_CHIEF . "Please be detained and be thoroughly whipped for tearing apart the Queens language," said @Erick_Merchant. MORE TROLLS "Considered using sign language??Cause this... this is beyond broken English... hii yako ni ulemavu... you need extensive therapy... you are butchering the language," @Barrack29515113 posted. "Me and my family offer our sincere condolences to your English grammar. Rest in Peace Queen's Language, we loved you but Ringtone Apoko loved you more #RingtoneArrested," wrote @JoshuaJerry. "Hapo kwa qualities za wife ongeza English teachers are encouraged to apply," said @17_mulla. "English is rounded off to the nearest mother tongue," @beryle_otieno commented.
