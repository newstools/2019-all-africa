Our beautiful baby boy was born Monday 3rd June mother and baby Divock Samrat Crouch are doing well pic.twitter.com/C8yYyY9Atv - Peter Crouch (@petercrouch) June 4, 2019 The 38 year-old has previously joked that they had thought about naming their fourth child Samrat after his favourite curry house. He has seemingly opted for Divock - with Samrat as a middle name - in tribute to Liverpool forward Divock Origi who netted the Reds second in their 2-0 win over Tottenham in the Champions League final over the weekend. Crouch later clarified: "Our boy is beautiful, the name is still to be clarified, unfortunately. Not going for Divock Samrat." That he even contemplated posting the name indicates how Divock's stock has risen following his exploits in the UEFA Champions League semis and final against Barcelona and Tottenham respectively Divock is a Belgian professional footballer born to Kenyan parents.
