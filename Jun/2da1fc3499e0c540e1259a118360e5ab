Starehe MP Charles Njagua has given Interior Secretary Fred Matiang'i and the Immigration department 24 hours to deport Chinese traders in city markets. The MP on Monday led traders and other leaders in a demonstration against the foreigners. He promised to personally arrest and take the foreigners to the airport if authorities to do not act in 24 hours. "The other day we saw Matiang'i claiming he had only deported six Chinese nationals yet we have hundreds in here. We are giving the government 24-hour ultimatum to deport them failure to which I will lead the locals in storming their shops and ejecting them," threatened Njagua. 'BEAT THEM' "We will march into their business premises and take them to the airport." City traders have raised concern at the influx of Chinese traders in informal markets. According to Business Daily, the foreigners are backed by strong financial muscle and have taken strategic control of the supply chain from import to wholesale and down to the retail level.
