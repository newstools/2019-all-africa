According to Rotich, the projected ICT expenditure will help create more jobs as it transforms the lives of Kenyans. ICT in this regard received an overall allocation of Ksh3.2billion for the Digital Literacy Programme, Ksh2.9 billion for Government Shared Services Ksh2.8 billion for National Optic Fibre Backbone Phase II expansion and Ksh1.1 billion for Installation of an Internet Based 4000 Network.

In the FY2017/18, the ICT sector real GDP (at constant prices) was UGX 6.04trillion compared to UGX 5.58trillion in FY2016/17. Similarly, ICT sector nominal GDP (at Current prices) increased from UGX 2.01trillion in FY2016/17 to UGX 2.67trillion in FY2017/18. The Ugandan government takes into account that contribution of ICT sector activities to the real national GDP accounted for 9.8 percent in FY2017/18 compared to 9.6 percent in FY2016/17. In addition, the ICT sector activities contribution to nominal GDP improved from 2.2 percent in FY2016/17 to 2.6 percent in FY2017/18. The sector's contribution to Government revenue totaled Ush 946.4bn (6.5 percent) of total Gross Revenue collection in FY2017/18. [UBoS in NITA-U Statistical Abstract 2018]. Under competitiveness, the sector contributes through reduction of the cost of doing business by investing in infrastructure (Transport, ICT, Energy) and improved access and dissemination of information to citizens and the economy in general. This can be achieved through reduction of costs of doing business (to lower the cost of bandwidth by investment ICT infrastructure) while acknowledging the role of both the private sector and government. The cost of bandwidth is projected to reduce from USD 300 per Mbps per month (2016) to USD 50 by 2020. The cost has since dropped to USD 70 per Mbps per month since 2017. Besides, ICT plays a crucial role towards improvement of the public sector management through effective and efficient delivery basic services. This can be attributed to enhanced usage and application of ICT services in Government, business and service delivery to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
