Being a model and a designer at the same time is undoubtadly a daunting task, but for 25-year-old Nyasha Matanha it is not a big deal. Matanha is a model and jewellery designer and she has a few crowns to her name on the ramp. "My modelling career gained momentum in high school where we had variety shows which had modelling as one of the categories," Matanha told Standard Style. "On countless occasions, I would walk away as either Miss Personality, first princess or be crowned the queen. "I am the reigning Miss Heroes Personality and first princess of the Miss Ruby pageant. This means a lot to me and it is a boost to my career and hopes for more pageants in the future as it is my dream to make it to Miss Zimbabwe." Her designing career is also something she is proud of and she is the owner of Adonai Jewelleries, which specialises in making ornaments and trinkets. "I started beads craftwork in December 2017 after training on the basics of the craft which basically depends on one's creativity. The training helped me on the designing of my modelling attire and their accessories. I design and make jewellery out of chains and beads. My designer name is Adonai Jewelleries," she said. "I make jewellery using beads and chains and also crame bracelets. I can do my own design or client's design when making jewellery. For the meantime, it is a handbag business and many of my clients are students at the Great Zimbabwe University." She said she loved modelling from a tender age having been a fan of modelling and fashion shows on television. "I think modelling chose me. I am tall, beautifull and I have the model figure, not forgetting my natural and best makeup which is my timeless smile. In fact, above all that was my mom's dream and now I love modelling," she said. A holder of a Geography and Environmental Studies degree from Midlands State University, Matanha said she is inspired by her father who is a hard worker and self-driven.
