Themed as the "Wind of Revival", the 2019 edition will also mark the release of Joe Mettle's already recorded 5th studio album with the same title as the theme for the concert. The album has some songs recorded earlier at the Hope City Church in April in a 'Live' atmosphere. Praise reloaded is an annual event which is organised by Joe Mettle Ministries and Partners.
