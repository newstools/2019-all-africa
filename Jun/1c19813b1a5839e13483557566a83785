Speaking at the handover ceremony in the capital, yesterday, Siyachitema said, they will definitely will not walk alone, the motto of Liverpool Football Club, where the finals will be happening. This was after the team had secured an enticing deal from Econet which included two cheques, valued at $422 500 and kits which will bear the Econet and the Cassava logos as the two official sponsors of the Gems. "With Econet on our side, we will never walk alone in Liverpool. Having said this, all the girls are in high spirits, we are rearing to go. We are promising the country that we are going there not to add numbers, but to compete and be counted. We are in the same pool with the world's number one, Australia, but we are not even intimidated. We are ready," Siyachitema said.
