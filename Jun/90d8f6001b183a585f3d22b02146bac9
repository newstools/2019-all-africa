In an interview with Power 105.1, a radio station in Los Angeles, the rapper said that she missed her flight while on a trip to Ghana and decided to attend a show where Burna Boy performed. "I met him in Ghana. I was in Africa for a show then I missed my flight, he had a show where he performed and I went to the show and the rest is history baby. He told me I was going to be his wife and you know how boys always talk shit, but I didn't remember he said that but he told me and I was like wow". Stefflon Don also revealed that Burna Boy told her people would soon see her wearing an engagement ring. "I'm not one of them crazy bitches I know he's gonna see this interview later and say 'What da f**k like I'm the wife.
