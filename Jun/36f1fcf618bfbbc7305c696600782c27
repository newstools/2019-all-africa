Stakeholders at a conference held by the National Association of Local Authorities of Ghana (NALAG), in Sunyani have made a passionate appeal to government to consider establishing integrated waste recycling plants in all the 16 regions to help create jobs. According to metropolitan, municipal, district chief executives (MMDCEs) and the presiding members (PMs), at the various local assemblies the establishment of the recycling pants was the best way of fulfilling government's industrialisation drive of establishing factories in every districts considering the limited timeframe to fulfill the promise. Mr Bernard Takyi, the Presiding member of Sunyani West Assembly, among other stakeholders interviewed at the conference, were of the view that establishing recycling plants in all the regions provided multiple benefits such as creating jobs for the youth, ensuring cleaner communities and also generating the needed revenues for the assemblies. Meanwhile, the Deputy Managing Director of Zoomlion Ghana Limited, Mrs Gloria Opoku Anti, in a presentation at the conference explained that an integrated approach to waste management with focus on recycling had improved economies of the world, hence the need for authorities to adapt the approach for sustainable waste management. Citing countries such as Dubai, Rwanda, and Mauritius who have adopted the approach and were noted as clean cities, Mrs Anti indicated that the President's vision of making Accra, the cleanest city in Africa, is achievable if Ghana adopted the waste recycling approach in all the regions. The 2019 NALAG delegates conference which was held in Sunyani, in the Bono Region, saw the election of Bismark Baisie Nkum, the Municipal Chief Executive of Gomoa West, in the Central Region as president to steer the affairs of the association.
