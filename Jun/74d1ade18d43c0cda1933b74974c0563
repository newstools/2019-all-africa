State Owned Mobile Telecommunications giant NetOne has stepped in to offer a solution to the salary payments crisis resulting from a dispute between local banks and Mauritian company, Paynet. NetOne Cellular has launched a bulk payments platform, termed "OnePay", which is a secure bulk payment service that allows an entity to process payments centrally to any OneMoney registered user. This also presents OneMoney with an opportunity to expand into the salary payments category and broaden its revenue stream. Speaking at the launch, chief mobile financial services officer, Nkosinathi Ncube said the service is available to corporate and government entities, state-owned enterprises, non-governmental organisations; or indeed any organisation which is in need of an effective payment solution. "At a time when individuals are craving the assurance that they will receive their salaries with speed, safety and consistency, the OnePay platform prides itself on its proven ability to deliver." "OnePay is a secure solution offering convenience at affordable rates and is hassle free as transaction statements can be printed or viewed from the OnePay portal." added Ncube. With OnePay, one simply uploads a bulk file with up to five thousands entries and immediately transfers money simultaneously, with each customer receiving a confirmation SMS instantly upon payment. OnePay has undergone rigorous testing and has been deployed to several private and public sector organisations and guarantees consumers of a secure, convenient service at affordable rates. OnePay customers will also enjoy OneMoney benefits which include ZIPIT to 19 banks, swiping at Zimswitch enabled POS machine with a OneMoney Debit Card, paying for bills, purchase of airtime through USSD menu *111#.
