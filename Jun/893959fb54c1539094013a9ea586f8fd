The US Embassy in Khartoum released a statement late on Thursday, after envoy Donald Booth concluded a four-day visit to the Sudanese capital. He expressed support for the Sudanese protest movement and called for a civilian-led government amid stalled negotiations between opposition forces and the TMC. Booth urged the military to "stop attacks on civilians, allow peaceful assembly and protest, and support an independent investigation into the horrific June 3 attack on the peaceful sit-in". He advocated for restoration of internet service and advised against unilaterally forming a government or organizing elections. Previous statements On June 4, the Troika condemned "the violent attacks in Sudan on June 3, which resulted in the killing and injuring of many peaceful civilian protesters. By ordering these attacks, the Transitional Military Council has put the transition process and peace in Sudan in jeopardy.
