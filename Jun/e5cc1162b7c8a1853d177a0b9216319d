Bhekisisa's latest policy dialogue takes a deep dive into one of the biggest challenges facing SA's HIV response at the 9th Aids conference. The data is stark and incontrovertible: HIV is spreading faster among teenage girls and young women than in any other group in South Africa. Almost four out of every 10 new HIV infections in the country occur among women between the ages of 15 and 24 - an infection rate up to four times that of their male peers. The key driver? Age-disparate sex.
