Nampower, Namdia and the Chamber of Mines of Namibia recently donated a joint amount of N$35 million towards the government's drought relief initiative. Nampower and Namdia each contributed N$15 million while the Chamber of Mines made a N$5 million contribution. This donation came as a result of the President's call for Offices, Ministries and government agencies to make provision of necessary drought relief assistance to drought affected communities. Geingob declared the current drought as a state of emergency in May and the Mines and Energy Minister Tom Alweendo extended the call to mines and energy stakeholders to make donations towards the initiative.
