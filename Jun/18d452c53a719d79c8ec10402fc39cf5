Accra â€” Most Africans support democratic elections as the best way to choose their leaders - if they see their previous elections as free and fair, and especially if those elections produced a change in leadership, new Afrobarometer survey data show. In the seventh of its Pan-Africa Profiles series based on recent public-opinion surveys in 34 African countries, Afrobarometer reports that popular support for elections is driven by the perceived freedom and fairness of the balloting process. And the strongest evidence of a free and fair election is a change in ruling party. "Simply stated, Africans support elections to the extent that these contests are seen to bring about desired political change," the analysis concludes. The new report, available at www.afrobarometer.org, indicates that while popular support for elections and assessments of election quality vary widely across countries and over time, a majority of Africans - both opposition-party and ruling-party supporters - have consistently seen their elections as generally free and fair. Key findings: Survey background Afrobarometer, a nonprofit organization headquartered in Ghana, is a pan-African, nonpartisan research network that conducts public attitude surveys on democracy, governance, economic conditions, and related issues in African countries. Six rounds of surveys were conducted between 1999 and 2015, and Round 7 survey findings in 34 countries are being released in 2018/2019. Afrobarometer conducts face-to-face interviews in the language of the respondent's choice with nationally representative samples. Sample sizes of 1,200-2,400 yield country-level results with a margin of sampling error of +/-2 to 3 percentage points at a 95% confidence level.
