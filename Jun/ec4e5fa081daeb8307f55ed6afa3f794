Gaborone â€” MRS Botswana on June 15 unveiled top 16 women who will compete in the beauty pageant slated for September. Now in its third year, June 15 's top 16 unveiling started with a marriage and family awareness fun walk. It sought to promote a positive image about the institution of marriage following international day of families, usually commemorated globally on May 15. The pageant, specifically for married women, is more than just looks as it seeks to be a platform for married women to share inspiration and motivation while building themselves and their families. The pageant also seeks to instill life skills such as self-defence, public speaking, beauty and home management skills such as baking. "Over and above that we really strive to nurture contestants to build healthy marriages and rock solid families. We want married women to focus more on the marriage itself and less on the wedding day," MRS Botswana director, Kgalalelo Lesetedi said in an interview. While the pageant has grown, funds and sponsors have not been as forthcoming. The pageant is volunteer run and struggling to attract corporate sponsors. "Social media has come in handy in marketing our initiative as we would otherwise struggle to get word out there through traditional commercial advertising," she stated. Through social media and word of mouth, the pageant has seen participation from women who reside outside Gaborone. "Ideally we should be out there touring towns and villages to recruit participants, but we cannot afford that at the moment and rely on interested participants transporting themselves to Gaborone for auditions." That notwithstanding, MRS Botswana has managed to attract local businesses within the beauty industry to sponsor them with locally produced beauty products. <i>Source : BOPA</i>
