The 2018/19 second round crop and livestock assessment report notes that 2018-2019 season was characterised by late rains across the country. "The false starts in the southern and south-eastern parts of the country affected the crop establishment," reads the report in part. "Long dry spells in January and February negatively affected the planted crop. Cyclone Idai, which hit the country in mid-February, caused severe damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure in Manicaland and Masvingo provinces. "However, it improved crop condition in Mashonaland East and Central." The condition of all livestock classes ranged from fair to good in all districts. Water for livestock was available in most districts as a result of Cyclone Idai-induced rains which improved the water situation in most water bodies in Mashonaland provinces, Manicaland and parts of Masvingo and Midlands. "Dipping is generally erratic due to critical shortage of chemicals with priority in allocation of the chemicals being given to areas that were severely affected by the outbreak of Theileriosis popularly known as January Disease," states the report.
