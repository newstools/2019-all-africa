Nairobi â€” Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has lauded President Uhuru Kenyatta's move of unveiling the new Sh1,000 currency notes aimed at fighting graft. The Maendeleo Chap Chap leader said the move was important due to billions of unpaid taxes and loot stolen from Kenyan citizens by some politicians who have stashed them in form of the current bank notes. "It is clear why the Sh1,000 notes are being recalled in such a public manner. We all suspect that unpaid taxes and loot stolen from our people by some leaders is stored in the form of these bank notes," he said. The governor added that the move was timely, and that more energy should be applied towards addressing any suspicious transactions happening in the banks. "This is a great step towards fighting corruption and cleaning up Kenya. I urge investigative bodies to track money being banked or converted into US dollars. What cannot be accounted for should be taken by the State and used to buffer the exchequer," said the governor in a press statement to newsrooms. He further urged citizens to remain confident of exchanging their clean-earned cash. "We must acknowledge some people keep legally obtained cash instead of banking it and they should be allowed to change what they have to the new bills. It is not illegal to keep cash. Wananchi should not be forced to bank their money," he said. The Central Bank Governor Patrick Njoroge declared that Sh1,000 notes will stop being a legal tender after October 1, 2019. Other currency notes including for Sh500, 200, 100 and 50 were also unveiled during the Madaraka Day Celebrations held in Narok County. Mutua also noted that the new directive on change of currency notes will also act as a catalyst to economic growth by having more money injected into the economy.
