Kenyan writer Dr Margaret Ogola, whose debut novel 'The River and the Source' won awards around the globe, was on Wednesday honoured by Google with a doodle. Dr Ogola died in September 2011. She would have been 60 today. Her debut novel followed four generations of Kenyan women in a rapidly changing country and society. "Happy to celebrate Kenyan award-winning author, activist and doctor, the late Dr Margaret Ogola, author of The River and the Source," wrote Goggle.

She burst into the Kenyan literary scene in the mid-1990s, and before her demise in September 2011, she had also written 'I Swear by Apollo' and 'Place of Destiny' 'The River and the Source' was a KCSE set book for many years. It has been translated into several languages, including Italian, Lithuanian and Spanish.
