African fintech has taken center stage for the Catalyst Fund, a JP Morgan Chase and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation-backed accelerator that provides mentorship and non-equity funding to emerging markets startups. The organization announced its 2019 startup cohort and three out of the four finance ventures -- Chipper Cash, Salutat and Turaco -- have an Africa focus (Brazil-based venture Diin, was the fourth).
