Cape Town â€” The countdown is on to the hottest production of the year - the eagerly awaited South African premiere of the multiple Tony award-winning musical Kinky Boots. Presented by Eric Abraham and The Fugard Theatre, a brand new, original production of this huge-hearted, smash-hit musical will run at The Fugard Theatre from 11 June 2019. Creating the role of shoe factory owner Charlie Price is Darren Craig, with Earl Gregory stepping in to the role of drag queen Lola. Namisa Mdlalose is Lauren, Amy Campbell is Charlie's girlfriend Nicola and Nathan Ro is Don. Inspired by true events, Kinky Boots was first brought to life on the big screen in 2005 before being transformed into a hit musical, winning six Tony and three Olivier Awards. The show features a Tony-winning score by Cyndi Lauper and a book by four-time Tony winner, Harvey Fierstein. "I'm so excited to bring Kinky Boots and its message of love and acceptance to South Africa, especially as it celebrates 25 years of Democracy. Audiences around the world have embraced the show, and I can't wait for South Africa to experience the joy that Kinky Boots brings to people!" said Cyndi.
