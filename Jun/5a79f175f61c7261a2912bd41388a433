Game of Thrones star Owen Teale will attend Amnesty International Blackheath & Greenwich Group's annual book sale on Saturday (15 June), boosting the profile of this already hugely popular yearly event. The all-day book sale - being held in the Church of the Ascension, Dartmouth Row, Blackheath SE10 8BF (9am-5pm) - is extremely popular with book-lovers across the capital, and last year the event raised more than Â£10,000 for Amnesty's human rights work. The sale is well known for its size and its range of high-quality books - from brand-new publications and hand-picked second-hand paperbacks, to review copies of recently-published novels. Owen Teale - Ser Alliser Thorne in the hit fantasy TV series - will give a short speech at the event at 10.30am, outlining his support for Amnesty's children's rights campaign which is challenging the Home Office's profit-making fee for registering a child as a British citizen. Rachel Errington, Amnesty International Blackheath & Greenwich Group Chair, said: "With over 15,000 quality books at bargain prices in a church hall, this is possibly the biggest charity fundraising book sale you'll ever come across. "Come along, hear Owen Teale - the recently-hanged Ser Alliser Thorne, back from the dead - eat some cake and, of course, buy some books."
