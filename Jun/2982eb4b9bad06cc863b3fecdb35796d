Police escorting buses on the Mandera-Rhamu-Elwak road narrowly escaped death on Saturday after an explosive planted on the road missed their vehicle. The Improvised Explosive Device was planted in the middle of the road. Mandera County Police Commander Jeremiah ole Kosiom said security teams had been dispatched to the nearby Chabibar and Bambo villages on Sunday to flush out the suspects. CHABIBAR "The attack was done by Chabibar locals and we will do our best to apprehend the suspects," he said. The tarmacking of Rhamu-Elwak road was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2016. "The fact that someone can dig and plant an explosive on the road tells a lot about the quality of work done by the contractor," said Mr Abdi Ismael a Mandera resident. Mr Ismael Maoy, a driver, said: "We thought the tarmac would discourage criminals from planting explosives on the road." PATROLS According to Mr Maoy, most public service vehicle drivers operating between Elwak and Rhamu in Mandera North are worried. "We need regular security patrols on the road to ensure that any suspicious characters are arrested and prosecuted," Mr Maoy said.
