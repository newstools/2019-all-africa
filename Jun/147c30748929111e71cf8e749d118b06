Nairobi â€” Kenya loses $8 billion (Sh800 billion) to corruption annually, according to the United States Ambassador to Kenya Kyle McCarter. He says, ironically this is the cost of President Uhuru Kenyatta's Big Four development agenda. The Ambassador says despite the renewed war on graft, Kenya continues losing billions of shillings, saying the war should not stop until the vice is stopped. He has urged the youths, more so university students, to join hands and demand accountability for taxpayer's money, whose loss will only deny them a future.
