Cape Town â€” SA's top live electronic act, GoodLuck and king of afro-house Music, DJ Ganyani have just released their second highly anticipated music video for their chart-topping track, Waiting For You. The music video released on top Dutch label, Armada Music's YouTube channel on Friday. The video, which was filmed in the heart of Jozi, features lead vocalist Jules from GoodLuck, DJ Ganyani, and an array of extremely talented dancers.
