Popular comedienne, Helen Paul, has raised concerns over various troll comments on the alleged marriage of a 20-year-old actress Regina Daniel to a famous billionaire businessman, Ned Nwoko. Paul took to her Instagram handle @itshelenpaul and on a video clip on Sunday, to suggest that rather than trolling, people should mind their businesses. She wrote: "Hypocrisy of the highest order, ladies are used to killing and condemning each other. Do you know what she has gone through? "Do you know what pushed her and her family to go into such a marriage? "There are people who get married at an older age and their husbands are using them as punching bag. "Why are we quick to judge women? The woman did this, the woman did that, What about the men? "Please let us leave issues that are sorted and focus on matters that truly need attention. "Nigeria is so big. Plenty problems to be solved o... "Every body na sinner! Better matter no go trend o.," she wrote. According to her, it was nobody's business to determine the age anyone should get married. She went ahead to advise the trollers to mind their business and probably go into charitable works as part of means of doing something meaningful with their time.
