France's bad boy rapper 'Kaaris' had to stop a concert in Ivory Coast's Abidjan Saturday after a near stampede. Police used truncheons and tear gas to contain crowd. A show by French-Ivorian rapper Kaaris in Abidjan had to be halted late Saturday after fans were injured during a crowd surge and subsequent violence, AFP reporters said. Kaaris, wearing an orange jersey of the national Ivory Coast football team, was into the fourth song of his set when fans knocked over security barriers and surged forward. Riot police struck out at the crowd with truncheons then fired tear gas as they struggled to contain them, and the concert was halted for an hour. Several people suffered minor injuries, and at least one fan blamed the police for the crowd surge. Almost 10,000 were at the festival of Urban Music (FEMUA) in the Anoumabo district of Abidjan. Kaaris returned an hour later to vent his anger on the crowd and call for calm. On Sunday, the rapper is to take part in an event in Gagnoa, western central Ivory Coast, where he was born.
