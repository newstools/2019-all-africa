Diamond Platnumz's Kenyan girlfriend Tanasha Donna has followed in the footsteps of her man by releasing her debut song titled Radio. Tanasha features rapper Barak Jacuzzi in the feel good song in which she sings in both English and Swahili. The song also has a heavy raggatone beat. The video to the song is on point capturing Tanasha in a well organised choreography. At some point she copies some of the dancing styles used by Diamond and Rayvanny in the Tetema song. "MY DEBUT SINGLE RADIO FT @barakjacuzzi IS OFFICIALLY OUT NOW!!!!! GO AND CHECK OUT THE LINK ON MY BIO!!! I've prayed so hard for this moment and it's been a tough and emotional one, I hope you guys enjoy it! Nothing but love. Nawapenda," wrote Tanasha. SURPRISE Tanasha has been dating Diamond for almost a year now but her move to venture into music comes as a surprise to many as she has never shown interest in being a singer. The new single has so far gotten more than 268k views. Tanasha first posted a 30 second snippet of the video which her online fans seemed to love. "If you a RAW DANCEHALL REGGAE type lover like us Kenyans love, You'l love this one! RADIO IS OFFICIALLY OUT CHECK THE LINK ON MY BIO!!!! @barakjacuzzi. A huge thanks to the entire team on board, amazing dancers/models their social media handles are all at the end of the video but will defos be tagging them along the way!Thank you for the love so far, I shall continue to grow and perfect my craft," she wrote.
