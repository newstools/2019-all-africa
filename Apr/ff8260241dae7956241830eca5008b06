Nairobi â€” Police have issued an alert regarding the three unnamed wanted terror suspects in the country who they argue are armed and dangerous. Inspector General of police Hillary Mutyambai circulated images of the three but did not name them. Members of the public with any information regarding the three terror suspects have been urged to come forward in order to help the police to narrow down on the whereabouts of the individuals described as extremely dangerous. He also urged terror suspects that may have been recruited and were looking for a way out, to surrender themselves to the authorities, and aid in investigations to bring the Kenya terrorist networks down. Mutyambai urged those who suspect that their relatives or acquaintances could have joined jihadi groups, are planning to travel to jihadi theatres, or have returned from countries known to harbour jihadists to immediately report to the nearest police station. He stated that the countries known to host known terrorists include Somalia, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Syria and Afghanistan.
