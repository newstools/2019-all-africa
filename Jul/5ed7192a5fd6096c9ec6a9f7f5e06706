The Liberian Ambassador will serve a two-year term alongside His Excellency Luis Gallegos Chiriboga, Permanent Representative of Ecuador to the United Nations who was elected as Chair of the CRPD, and other members of the Bureau. The 12th Session of the Conference of State Parties to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), convened at the United Nations Headquarters from May 11-13, 2019, under the overarching theme: Ensuring the inclusion of persons with disabilities in a changing world through the implementation of the CRPD.
