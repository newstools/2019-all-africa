The reigning Miss World, Ms Vanessa Ponce de Leone, and Miss World Africa Quiin Abenakyo, have said it is sad to see girls drop out of school, suffer menstrual hygiene management and get pregnant at an early age. The two beauty queens, who were on Wednesday touring Kagulu Cultural Hill in Buyende District, said they have chosen to run a campaign of keeping girls in school. "Parents should ensure girls get education. We want girls to remain and complete school. We also need to ensure that their dignity is protected," the beauty queens said, pointing at the Speaker of Parliament, Ms Rebecca Kadaga, and the Buyende Woman MP, Ms Veronica Kadogo, as female role models. Tourism hub Miss Ponce de Leone expressed excitement at the hospitality, beauty and determination of the people of Busoga, observing that the cultural, religious and community sites are 'splendid tourism sites with rich history and significance'. She added that she was honoured to be hosted by the Speaker and the Woman MP, describing it as an inspiration towards an affirmative action for the young girls. "I am humbled, excited and appreciative of the great hospitality, but also touched by the determination of the young girls and health drive," she said. Ms Kadogo commended the beauty queens for changing the face of their crowns and pointed out that the historic visit and health camp was a boost to the girls' education. She added that the medical camp was to boost the girls' health and drum up support for child mothers, girls who are out of school and fight defilement which was Ms Abenakyo's theme during her beauty competitions. The reigning Miss World jetted into the country on Tuesday ahead of today's Miss Uganda pageant where she will be the chief guest.
