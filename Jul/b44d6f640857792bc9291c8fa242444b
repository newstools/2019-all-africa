Mr Asiamah, who is also Member of Parliament (MP) for Atwima Mponua, dismissed allegations that the Ghanaian contingent went on excursion following the team's elimination from the tournament. Contrary to reports that some supporters were stranded in Egypt, the minister said "no supporter was stranded in Egypt." Mr Asiamah indicated that the supporters did not go to Egypt as a group, but as individuals with different visa durations, and that their return was pre-arranged and that those still in Egypt were there based on the dates of return per their flight tickets. "Mr Speaker, a detailed tournament report is to be provided by the Normalisation Committee by July 26, 2019 after which major recommendations and decisions with regard to the re-organisation of football in Ghana will be taken," he told the House. Commenting on the statement, the Minority Spokesperson on Youth, Sports and Culture Committee, Kobena Mensah Woyome, asked for detailed account on what was spent on the MPs as against what was spent on the supporters. He questioned what criteria were used in selecting the supporters as there were still complaints of favouritism in the selection process. The Chairman of the committee and MP for Mpohor, Alex Kofi Agyekum, said that the committee had already written to the minister to appear before it for a thorough breakdown of all monies spent at the tournament.
