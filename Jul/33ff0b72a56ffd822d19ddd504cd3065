Nairobi â€” Governors have dismissed what the government described as a revision of the revenue share to counties, with a purported allocation of Sh316 billion up from Sh310 billion. A statement issued on Tuesday night by the Council of Governors Chairman Wycliffe Oparanya said there was nothing new in the purported allocation and insists that the Sh316 billion is already in contention with a challenge already filed in court. Oparanya insists that Governors will not take anything less than Sh335 billion recommended by the Commission of Revenue Allocation. The proposal by the Commission on Revenue Allocation has been opposed by the National Treasury and National Assembly, with Majority Leader Aden Duale accusing the commission of making unrealistic recommendations.
