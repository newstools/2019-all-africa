Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire — The African Development Bank and the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences Next Einstein Initiative (AIMS-NEI), signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Monday to strengthen education, training and research in mathematical sciences in Africa. "Africa must not sit on the sidelines as others create technology and we consume it. If we want to leverage AI and other cutting edge technologies and compete globally, we must train researchers and engineers who create the equations and algorithms that create transformative technologies. That's what we are doing at AIMS," said Thierry Zomahoun, President and CEO of AIMS, at the ceremony held at the Bank's headquarters in Abidjan. The partnership sets the framework for collaboration between the two institutions on enhanced mathematical research and innovation in key areas of the continent's development challenges. It will also facilitate the design and implementation of new projects and programs and further cooperation in events related to science and technology. Over the past 15 years, AIMS has contributed massively to the advancement of mathematical sciences for human capital development in Africa. Their interventions have been in advanced training at post-graduate level, basic research, industry for educational outreach and high-level policy dialogue. Speaking at the signing, African Development Bank Vice President for Agriculture and Human Development, Jennifer Blanke stressed the strong partnership between the Bank and AIMS-NEI. "The MOU gives us a framework for the operationalization of the partnership," she said.
