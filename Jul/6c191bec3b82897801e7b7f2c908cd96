Cape Town — A chief executive officer (CEO) is elected by the board of a company and its shareholders. He or she is the highest-ranking executive in a company, whose primary responsibilities include making major corporate decisions and managing the overall operations and resources of a company. The CEO also acts as the main point of communication between the board of directors (the board) and corporate operations, and is the public face of the company. With all this in mind, one wonders if the pressures of such a position then warrants the enormous salaries that many CEOs earn. I took a look at salaries earned at the top 12 companies on the Top 40 listed on the JSE and this is what it looks like. Naspers Leading the pack should be Bob Van Dijk, CEO of Naspers, a multinational internet and media group, offering services in more than 130 countries. His take-home pay was ... wait for it ... R1,7 billion including other bonuses or incentives. So how do the rest match up? Not by a long shot - but let's have a look at the numbers for 2018: Investec The bank's CEO Steven Koseff earned his remuneration in pounds. The basic salary came to £1.7m or R31.17m.
