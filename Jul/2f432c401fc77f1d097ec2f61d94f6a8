Popular Zimdancehall chanter Freeman, real name Sylvester Chizanga, will be stepping out of his comfort zone when he launches his ninth studio album titled Gango which he describes as a project that consists of a variety of genres. Gango album launch slated for 24 August at Old Hararians Sports Club is sponsored by local paint making company Nash Paints. Addressing journalists today, Freeman highlighted that the album title, coined from a popular recipe of assorted meats in one pot, describes his latest project's contents that are characterized by odd collaborations across different genres. "The album title entails of the contents this project is carrying. In this album I did not restrict myself within Zimdancehall, there are several songs that are divorced from my original genre. Some collaborations contained in this album will shock some of you as I roped in artists outside Zimdancehall, hence the title," he said. According to Freeman the edge to show his versatility also inspired the multi-genre 10-track album. "It is also important for me as an artist to show my versatility, it helps our quest to draw audience across the borders," he said. Meanwhile, the month of August has a lot in store for music lovers with the Mbare duo of Souljah Love and Seh Calaz set to also release their albums in the same month.
