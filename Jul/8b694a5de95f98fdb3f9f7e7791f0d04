Accra â€” RISING violence has raised fears of chaotic polls in a number of countries in the volatile West African region next year. Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Niger and Togo are preparing for polls under an atmosphere characterized by conflict, mostly caused by Islamist groups. Violence and insecurity have sparked an unprecedented humanitarian crisis leaving 5,1 million Burkinabe, Nigerians and Malians in need. In Burkina Faso alone, 226 security incidents led to fresh displacement, as well as the closure of 2 024 schools and 37 health centres. In the Lake Chad Basin, Boko Haram splinter groups remain active and dealt Chad's military its deadliest assault to date when fighters killed 23 soldiers. Vigilante groups aligned to government are fostering instability in Ghana, a largely peaceful country. Inter-communal tensions, conflicts between herders and farmers, and disputes over water and arable land are also rife in West Africa "Democratic progress in the region has been delayed and complicated, and sometimes, almost negated by a rapid expansion of violent extremism," said Mohamed Ibn Chambas, Head of United Nations Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS). He said tackling potential sources of conflict in West Africa was critical ahead of high-stakes elections. Despite the violence, credible presidential elections were organized in Mauritania, Nigeria and Senegal in recent months.
