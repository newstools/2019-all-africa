The Bridge has also been remade in Malaysia/Singapore, Germany/Austria, Croatia/Serbia, U.S./Mexico, UK/France and Russia/Estonia. The African adaptation will be the seventh local version of the show. "We are thrilled to adapt the award-winning series The Bridge for South Africa and the continent. I've always been a great fan of the series and admired how sensitively remakes were made in parts of the world that are so culturally different. It shows how the story and the characters are able to strike a universal chord, and we intend to create an adaptation that will be equally unique and will resonate with African viewers," says Thierry Cassuto, founder and executive producer at Both Worlds Pictures.
