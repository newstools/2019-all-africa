Gombe â€” No fewer than 7, 500 children are at the risk of becoming severely malnourish as a result of impending shortage of Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF), supplement use to treat acute malnutrition in children. Findings by North East Trust revealed that at least 300 new cases of malnourished children are register monthly at each of the five LGAs with the Centre the Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM). The Nutrition officer of Gombe Local Government Area, Mohammed Bawa, said they have run out of stock since January when they had the last supply of the RUTF. "The supply resumed only last Friday and there is fear that it will not last beyond September over non-release of counterpart funding by the last administration and the likely withdrawal of UNICEF from the RUF programme," he said. Bawa disclosed that the 500 cartons of the RUTF received at his centre may last for only two months considering the high demand from within and, especially, outside Gombe metropolis. During a visit to one of the CMAM site in Gombe metropolis, several nursing mothers, with their malnourished children, were seen waiting to be given the RUTF ration for their children.
