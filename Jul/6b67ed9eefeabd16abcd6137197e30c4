Rome â€” The number of people going hungry has risen for the third year running after years of improvement, the United Nations said in a report published on Monday that blamed conflict, climate shocks and economic slowdowns. Here are seven things you need to know about world hunger. 1. Globally, 821.6 million people or 11% of the population, suffer from hunger. 2. Africa has the highest percentage of hungry people globally, with one in five people going hungry. The number rises to nearly one in three in east Africa. 3. Hunger is increasing in many countries where economic growth is lagging, particularly in middle-income countries and those that rely heavily on exporting commodities. 4. In every continent, women are more likely to go hungry than men, although the largest gap is in Latin America. 5. There has been no progress since 2012 in reducing low birthweight - when children are born below their optimum weight, putting them at a higher risk of dying or from stunted growth. 6. Africa and Asia had the greatest share of all forms of malnutrition, accounting for more than nine out of 10 of all stunted children - and nearly three-quarters of all overweight children. 7. In upper-middle and high-income countries, people living in households where getting enough food is a struggle are more likely to become obese.
