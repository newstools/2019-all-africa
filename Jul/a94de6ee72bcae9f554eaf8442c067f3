Luanda â€” The Angolan Government and the World Bank formalized on Tuesday, July 23, the signing of the Development Policy Financing (DPO) agreement, worth US $ 500 million as well as the National System Reinforcement agreement of Social Protection, valued at USD 320 million. These agreements were signed at the premises of the Ministry of Finance and were signed by the resident representative of the World Bank, Olivier Lambert and the Minister of Finance, Archer Mangueira. These agreements come from funding recently approved by the World Bank Group Board of Directors in Washington, which is intended to be implemented in three structuring initiatives of the Angolan Executive - there is also an amount of USD 500 million for the funding of the BITA water project. According to a Ministry of Finance statement that Angop had access at the time, Finance Minister Archer Mangueira stated that these operations will be carried out at the appropriate time, as measures are being taken to correct macroeconomic imbalances while the Government preserves its concern with the structuring of the social protection system. "With regard to the social protection system we have the technical collaboration of the World Bank, and more than making cash transfers to vulnerable families, the important thing will be to create conditions for these families to achieve their self-support," said the official Finance Minister, at a ceremony attended by Minister of Social Action, Family and Women's Promotion, Faustina Alves and the Secretary of State for Budget and Public Investment, Aia-Eza da Silva.
