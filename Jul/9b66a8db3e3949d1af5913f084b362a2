Johannesburg â€” TV personality Bonang Matheba is back to host the Miss South Africa pageant once again. The star, who hosted the 2018 edition of the show, has been long associated with the Miss SA organisation, having been part of the judging panel in 2014 which officially crowned Rolene Strauss. In a statement to the press, Bonang expressed her delight at having the chance to host the pageant again. "I feel very honoured to be part of this two-hour spectacular, particularly as it is taking place on Women's Day," she said. Not only will B get to host the show, but her House of BNG MCC will also be the official Miss South Africa celebration sponsor. About this, she added: "The House of BNG has been a passion project of mine for a long time. It's no secret that bubbly is my favourite drink, so getting the chance to make my own MCC was an opportunity I couldn't miss out on!" Miss SA 2019 will be crowned on 9 August at the Sun Arena, Time Square in Pretoria. This year the winner will walk away with close to R3 million in prize money and sponsorships. The event will be broadcast live on M-Net and Mzanzi Magic. Source: Supplied
