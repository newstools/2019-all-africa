Gaborone â€” Madi Majwana: Stories from Your Pocket, a popular radio drama and stage production, is back. Season five offers a fresh perspective on the economic outlook of Batswana, revealing the hard-hitting realities of those who struggled with their finances. Speaking at a press briefing recently, Barclays Bank of Botswana managing director, Keabetswe Moshagane-Pheko, said this year's tour would be engaging, exciting and even bigger. "Communities should look forward to interactions with the Madi Majwana stage show at Barclays's branches in Ghanzi, Gumare, Maun, Kasane, Francistown, Selebi Phikwe, Bobonong, Palapye, Serowe, Mahalapye and Gaborone," she said. She indicated that the bank had invested almost P5 million towards Madi Majwana and over 300 performing artists had been employed while over 4 000 were exposed through direct engagements in various communities across the country, raising awareness and giving education around financial literacy. Meanwhile, this year's Madi Majwana would include unemployed young women who depended on others for financial support, women-led households and youth who had established and running businesses. It would also include those with financial foresight that could leave behind a legacy of the positive use of money. The project would use applied drama in its various forms to creatively interrogate money related issues facing Batswana. Through such method of interrogating issues, the project was able to unearth a deeper understanding of the problem, evoking dialogue and awareness around such issues and had significantly contributed in ultimately finding and identifying tangible solutions. To date, Madi Majwana: Stories from Your Pocket has each year evolved to include public debates, a documentary and financial literacy festival and the programme has reached 400 000 Batswana through radio, stage tour, workshops and social media.
