Thank you @Beyonce for this Gift!! #BrightnessIsJustWhoYouAre A post shared by Lupita Nyong'o (@lupitanyongo) on Jul 19, 2019 at 10:29am PDT The song also features Beyonce's seven-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy. The 14-track album was released on Friday and features songs from Kendrick Lamar, Jay-Z, Pharrell, and Childish Gambino. Beyonce said the album features many acts from Africa because she wants it to be about authentic music from the continent. "I wanted to make sure we found the best talent from Africa and not just use some of the sound or my own interpretation of it," she said in an interview.
