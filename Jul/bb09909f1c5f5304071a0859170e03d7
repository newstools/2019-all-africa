Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire — The Ethics Office of the African Development Bank has been nominated to chair the 12th conference of the Ethics Network of Multilateral Organisations (ENMO) next year, to be hosted by the World Bank, possibly in Washington D.C, USA. The ENMO, consisting of United Nations bodies and international and regional financial institutions, made the unanimous nomination at their 11th conference, held at the headquarters of the European Patent Office in Munich, Germany last week. Members of the network, represented by experts and stakeholders managing ethical practice within their organisations, also reaffirmed their commitment to the group's guiding principles and values: professionalism, ethics, transparency and integrity. The 11th conference discussed 'Due diligence in recruiting new employees', 'Communication strategy to strengthen ethical culture within organisations', 'Whistle-blower protection and reprisals', 'Analysing conflicts of interest and organisational risk', and 'Promoting respect in the workplace'. "Disrespect, intimidation and violence in the workplace are serious problems for institutions. It is important to have respect in the workplace, with a positive effect on morale so that members of staff can work in a non-toxic environment," said the network's outgoing president Graham Olivia Nanette. ENMO provides its members with a platform for collaboration and exchange of information on issues of common interest and relevant to ethical practice. This enables them to expand their professional capacity and advocacy for basic ethical standards within the affiliated organisations.
