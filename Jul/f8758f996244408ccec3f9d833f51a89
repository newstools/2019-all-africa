There is trouble in paradise as United Kingdom-based businesswoman, Olinda Chapel (35) publicly declares that she is now in an open relationship with her 29-year-old husband, Njabulo "Tytan" Nkomo. This follows Olinda's realisation that Tytan cheated with her best friend identified as Fungai about a year ago. In a live social media video, Olinda ruled out the generational gap between them as a factor that provoked her husband's infidelity. "Generational gap theories that some of you are trying to point out as the precipitator of this do not apply here, Fungai is three years older than I am, she is almost in her 40s," said Chapel. She added that Tytan has been granted a hall pass where he is allowed to hunt and sleep around. "From today onwards, Tytan and Olinda are in an open relationship. He is allowed to go out and hunt wherever. I am giving him a hall pass, I don't want you people to be surprised If you happen to bump into him with other women, he has a pass," she said addressing her social media following. Although Olinda's conduct of non-selectively taking her relationship developments online does not sit well with certain people, she has indicated that she will not be stopping at any time. "This is a public relationship, we kept you posted on everything from the moment he proposed love to me even up to when I conceived, he sang Bho for me and all of you listened. Why then would I keep our problems private when it is a public relationship?" she queried. Olinda will be turning 36 in August and has advised her followers to send word of her forthcoming birthday to ex-husband, Stunner.
