But the Black Stars responded in style eight minutes later when a three-man move involving Andre Ayew, Baba Abdul Rahman and Partey gave birth to the second goal. Ayew found Baba on the left, who cut in and Partey tapped home from close range to put them on the path of victory. The younger Ayew nearly capped his day with the second but his effort hit the upright on 78 minutes despite Mendes beaten. Ghana held on to victory to maintain their enviable record of going past the group stage at every edition since 2008. Total Man of the Match: Mubarak Wakaso (Ghana) What they said Mubarak Wakaso (Total Man of the match) I congratulate my teammates for the work we did together; this trophy is theirs too. This is our first victory in this AFCON and we are happy. Now, it's a matter of continuing the work to be more solid for the rest of this competition and achieve our goal. James Kwesi Appiah (Coach, Ghana) I congratulate my players for achieving such a result. We started the game on a slow pace because we had to be patient without rushing. It should also be noted that we adapt our game system according to the qualities and shortcomings of the opponent. If we are to take criticism into account, we will stop playing football. We are working to improve and I am doing my best to win the matches. Baciro CandÃ© (Coach, Guinea-Bissau) We played well in the first half and we were close to scoring. We had a special plan to win and the first half ended barren. In the second half we continued with the same strategy but made mistakes. And everything changed in one minute with Ghana's first goal. I congratulate Ghana coach for delivering a good match.
