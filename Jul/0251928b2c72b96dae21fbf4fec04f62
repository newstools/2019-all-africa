A global cybersecurity key player, Kaspersky has announced cooperation with Interpol, signing a new five-year agreement to reinforce their collaboration in the fight against cybercrime around the world. This second agreement between the two parties after the first was signed in 2014 will see to Kaspersky providing human resources support, trainings and threat intelligence data on the latest cybercriminal activities to INTERPOL while strengthening the organisation's cyberthreat hunting capabilities. The ceremony took place at INTERPOL World 2019, which is currently underway in Singapore. "With the rise of sophisticated threat actors, collaboration across the ecosystem and the sharing of expertise is more crucial than ever. We are excited to continue the partnership with INTERPOL and to empower law enforcers with the information and technology needed to combat cybercrime across the globe," said Eugene Kaspersky, CEO of Kaspersky. This cooperation strengthens the existing relationship between the two organisations, ensuring information and technology sharing can support INTERPOL in cybercrime-related investigations. Within the new agreement, Kaspersky will share information about its cyberthreat research and provide the necessary tools to assist with full digital forensics, aimed at strengthening efforts on the prevention of cyberattacks. Kaspersky recognises the borderless nature of cybercrime and regularly participates in joint operations and cyberthreat investigations with the global IT security community, international organisations such as INTERPOL, law enforcement agencies and CERTs worldwide. The first among cybersecurity vendors, the company recently announced an advanced free service for Law Enforcement Agencies, aimed at increasing the awareness of how Kaspersky services operate and how they can help fight cybercrime and sophisticated cyberthreats. rse
