Nigerian boxer, Anthony Joshua caused a social media frenzy following his visit to Fela Kuti's New Afrika Shrine. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Joshua has been on a Nigerian tour, visiting several landmarks and interacting with fans. The British boxer, who constantly connects with his Nigerian roots via social media, shared the video of his visit on his Twitter handle @anthonyfjoshua. In the video, Joshua is seen mixing up with fans before meeting Femi Kuti who showed him around the Shrine. Commenting under the post, fans joked that Joshua had come to Nigeria to fortify himself for the upcoming match against Andy Ruiz.
