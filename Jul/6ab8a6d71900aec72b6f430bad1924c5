The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, on Wednesday appealed to the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) to shelve its proposed industrial action over the delay in implementation of the N30,000 minimum wage. Mr Lawan made the appeal when the executives of the NLC and the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria, (PASAN) led by Ayuba Waba and Sunday Sabiyi paid him a courtesy visit in Abuja. He called for further understanding and patriotism, adding that some states had started paying the agreed minimum wage. "We should not encourage personal issue to overshadow our collective responsibility to nation-building. "We will journey with you to ensure absolute implementation of the minimum wage by the Federal government," Mr Lawan pleaded. He also assured PASAN to collaborate with the management and leadership of the National Assembly, urging it to present issue-based arguments, instead of embarking on a strike to press home its demands. He also said the ninth assembly would not be detracted, but remained focused in pursuing growth in every sector of the country. The NLC president later presented a congratulatory card to Mr Lawan on his emergence as the Chairman of the National Assembly. He also pledged the commitment and collaboration of the labour unions to the legislators. Earlier, the Chairman, PASAN, Mr Sabiyi, congratulated Mr Lawan on what he described an impressive emergence as the President of the Senate. He urged him to put into use, his wealth of experience as a ranking senator to the service and protection of the interests of Nigerians. Mr Sabiyi used the occasion to present the demands of the parliamentary staff in the National Assembly. He listed the demands to include implementation of 2018 arrears of 28 per cent and balance of 50 per cent consolidated Legislative salary, implementation of the condition of service recently approved by the eighth National Assembly, training of staff, health insurance and life insurance premium.
