Khartoum â€” SOME 126 aid workers were killed, 130 kidnapped and 143 others wounded globally in the year 2018. This makes the year the second-worst on record for aid worker security, with 399 workers affected by violence in 221 separate attacks. Rebel groups are largely blamed. According to the non-governmental organisation (NGO), Humanitarian Outcomes, South Sudan continues to experience the highest number of attacks. South Sudan, the world's newest country has been under civil war since 2013, two years after independence. Recent mass hostage-takings there have driven up global kidnapping figures. Kidnappings also increased in Afghanistan. Violence against the humanitarians increased sharply in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) during the period. This is due to increased criminal activity amid a spate of attacks on Ebola responders. The year 2018 is the second-worst, after 2013, in terms of violations against aid workers. In 2013, Humanitarian Outcomes documented 265 incidents. Out of these, 156 aid workers were killed, 140 kidnapped and 178 injured. The NGO has been documenting violations since 2009. For all years, the database records 29 victims of sexual violence, all female, among aid workers. The number is assumed to be artificially low due to under-reporting. Sexual violence was used in 8 percent of all attacks involving female victims. "Organisations can help increase reporting, and thereby better understand and address the problem, by taking proactive measures to remove the current obstacles and onus on the victims," Humanitarian Outcomes stated.
