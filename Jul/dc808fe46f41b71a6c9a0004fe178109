Kigali — SUB-Saharan Africa will remain the world's fastest-growing mobile region over the coming years as millions of young African consumers become mobile users for the first time. This is according to a new GSMA (Groupe Spéciale Mobile Association/ Mobile Special Group Association) study released in Kigali, Rwanda. It reveals that more than 160 million new unique mobile subscribers will be added across the region by 2025, bringing the total to 623 million, representing around half of the region's population, up from 456 million (44 percent) in 2018. Africa has an estimated total population of 1,216 billion. Subscriber additions will be concentrated in high-growth markets such as Nigeria (201,09 million population) and Ethiopia (110,2 million population). "A new generation of youthful 'digital natives' across Sub-Saharan Africa are set to fuel customer growth and drive adoption of new mobile services that are empowering lives and transforming businesses," said Akinwale Goodluck, Head of Sub-Saharan Africa, GSMA. "With mobile technology at the heart of Sub-Saharan Africa's digital journey, it is essential for policymakers in the region to implement policies and best practices that ensure sustainable growth in the mobile industry, and enable the transition to next-generation mobile networks." The study by GSMA calculates that the mobile ecosystem across Sub-Saharan Africa generated almost $150 billion in economic value last year - equivalent to 8,6 percent of the region's gross domestic product (GDP). It is forecast to generate almost $185 billion (91 percent of GDP) by2023. GSMA represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide, uniting more than 750 operators and nearly 400 companies in the broader mobile-ecosystem.
