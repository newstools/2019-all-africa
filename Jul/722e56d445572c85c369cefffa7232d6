Congratulating Burna Boy, Country Manager, VIMN Africa, Bada Akintunde-Johnson said; "We are indeed ecstatic to celebrate Burna Boy and his incredible win at the BET Awards today. This win further reiterates the fact that Nigerian music is a force to be reckoned with in the global industry and cannot be overlooked. We at Viacom International Media Networks Africa are particularly keen on sharing the reimagined African story to the world through music and we feel very strongly about starting conversations and actions that move us closer and closer to the realities we all desire" The BET brand has always actively supported music and African artistes all over the world, and this celebration is just one of many to come.
