"You don't even know how happy I am to be back in Africa, back in Kenya. There's never a better time. There's never a better place. I think here in Kenya I have a connection, that's why besides the performance, I want to do something for the society in Kenya, something good that I can be remembered for in Kenya," Jah Cure said.
