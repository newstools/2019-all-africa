Instagram could be one step closer to concealing your likes after it announced that it had added more countries as they start testing what would make the likes one gets on their photos invisible. Likes, which appear as hearts on Instagram, are often used as a measure of popularity. The test removes the total number of likes on photos and videos, but the owner of the account will still be able to see them. Likes will not appear on the main feed, profiles or permalink pages, according to Instagram. "We want your friends to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get. You can still see your own likes by tapping on the list of people who've liked it, but your friends will not be able to see how many likes your post has received," said Instagram.
