THIS year's edition of the annual Street Academy Health walk was held at the weekend in Accra with a number of corporate bodies joining over 800 children to walk through the principal streets of Accra. Organisations such as Barclays Bank, MTN, Goil, Cal Bank, Right to Play and Naidvar Trust participated in the three-hour walk that started at 7am at the Arts Centre through Makola, Tudu, Farisco and the High Street and back to the starting point. Also in Attendance was young Ghanaian female pilot of Passion Air, Audrey Esi Swatson - a friend of the Academy. The walk was intended to raise awareness on the plight of less-fortunate children as well as emphasise the importance of education. Head of Governance and Control at Barclays Bank, Abena Bonsu, described the walk as a successful one as the set target was achieved. "As we walked through the streets, people stopped us to inquire about the exercise and so we took the opportunity to talk to them about the plight of street children and also their education and how they could help." She indicated that Barclays had been a long-term partner of the Academy - supporting them with logistics, career guidance as well as their presence at key functions. She entreated other corporate bodies to join the cause of the Academy in alleviating the challenges faced by street children. Executive Director of Street Academy, Ataa Lartey, expressed excitement at the turn-out, stating that the aim was to make the exercise bigger each year. He said the moment was an exciting one for the children as well as a way of engaging them in a healthy way of living - a key factor of embarking on the walk. On the sideline of the event was the introduction of Street Academy's international partner Naidvar Trust, who are in the country for the first time to officially launch their project with the Academy.
