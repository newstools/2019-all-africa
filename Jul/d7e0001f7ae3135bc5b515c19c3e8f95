Gaborone â€” Botswana values its symbiotic relationship with Switzerland, President Dr Mokgweetsi Masisi has said. Speaking during a farewell courtesy call from Switzerland ambassador, Ms Helene Budliger Artieda in Gaborone on July 2, he said Botswana also cherished Switzerland's facilitation of multilateral work and Botswana's entry into the European market. President Masisi said Botswana was committed to its relationship with diamantaires in Switzerland. "We love what they do, the quality of goods they produce with the rarity of our precious stones," he said Botswana, he stated, looked up to Switzerland's innovation in growing the dairy sector. "We want to grow the dairy sector to start producing feta cheese, so we so look forward to the Swiss technology to do that," he added. For her part, Ms Artieda said she appreciated the vibrant relationship that the two countries had. She said Switzerland acknowledged Botswana's role and participation in the multilateral arena. She congratulated Botswana for continuing to be an oasis of peace and stability in the African region and for being a lighthouse in issues of international criminal justice and human rights at the International Criminal Court. "We admire Botswana for taking a principal stance and taking rule of law seriously," she said. She said Botswana and Switzerland had signed mutual visa exemption for holders of diplomatic, official and service passport. "We do this because Geneva hosts a number of key international organisations, so we want to ease travel for Batswana on official missions to Geneva," she said. Ms Artieda further solicited Botswana's support for Switzerland candidate for the UN Security Council 2023/2024. Source : BOPA
