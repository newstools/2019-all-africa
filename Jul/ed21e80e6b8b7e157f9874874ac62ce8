Nairobi â€” A survey conducted by Ipsos Kenya finds that roads, health and education are the most important development projects implemented by county governments since the start of devolution in 2013. According to the survey, which was conducted between 24 and 28th June, 56 percent of respondents cited construction of roads as the most important project implemented followed by health, education and water at 12 and 10 percent respectively. Ipsos Director Hilda Kiritu says most counties see these sectors as key to attracting investors. "If you look further, you will note that county residents feel that devolution has led to improvement of infrastructure, especially rural roads," Kiritu. Only 1 percent of the 1,320 respondents targeted cited agriculture, security and electricity as important projects. The Service delivery index survey was commissioned by Kenya Alliance of Resident Associations (KARA) and carried out in Nairobi, Uasin Gishu, Nakuru, Mombasa and Kisumu.
