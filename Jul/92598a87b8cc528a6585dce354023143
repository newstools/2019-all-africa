Johannesburg â€” Comic Con Africa 2019 is just two months away, and this year the event promises to be even bigger and better. With an estimated 60 000 visitors expected, there will be 160 hours of content on offer across five halls, which include panel discussions with celebrities, competitions, seminars, and workshops. Some of the international celebs added to the line-up so far are Avengers actor Anthony Mackie and Game of Thrones star Isaac Hempstead Wright. Voice actors Nolan North and Troy Baker will also be present at the festival. This year Comic Con Africa also welcomes its first-ever KidsCon. As the first and entirely kid-focused convention in Africa, KidsCon is taking the term "fun and games" to the next level by empowering children to be expressive and embrace their individuality. Comic Con Africa 2019 takes place from 21 to 25 September at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Johannesburg. Source: Supplied
