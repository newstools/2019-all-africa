Theresa May, Johnston's immediate predecessor resigned on Wednesday over Brexit after Johnston won the Conservative Party elections on Tuesday. Brexit issue has produced two casualty prime ministers, David Cameron and May and analysts say if Johnston fails to handle the matter well, he might be another casualty. He has promised to pull his country out of the European Union on October 31 by any means necessary, saying he will defy "the doubters, the doomsters and the gloomsters" by completing Brexit with a deal on deadline. Standing outside 10 Downing Street after visiting the Queen, he gave a speech infused with patriotic pronouncements, saying the "people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts".
