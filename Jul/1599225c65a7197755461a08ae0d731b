Johannesburg â€” This year, the team at DStv Delicious International Food and Music Festival have outdone themselves by adding even more flavour and a world-class line-up to celebrate Heritage Weekend at the Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit on 21 and 22 September. International megastars Raphael Saadiq, Corinne Bailey Rae, Tiwa Savage and a host of artists from Kalawa Jazmee Records (to be announced) will perform live on the Delicious Main Stage in what is being tipped as the biggest DStv Delicious International Food and Music Festival to date. If you need a living definition of delicious music, look no further than Corinne Bailey Rae who is consistent proof of that. The singer was the fourth female artist in British history to have her first album debut at number one. Corinne Bailey Rae has scooped two Grammy Awards, and her soulful songs feature in many TV series and films. With a virtually bottomless history of collaborations, tours, performances, and recordings with other major international artists, Corinne is an inspiration both as a philanthropist and as a musician. She will be one of the main acts on Saturday, 21 September at Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit. Joining Corinne Bailey Rae on the Delicious Main Stage is none other than Africa's shining star, Tiwa Savage. Hailing from Lagos, Nigeria, Tiwa Savage has taken the world by storm and will give an all African excellence at DStv Delicious International Food and Music Festival. Known for some of our favourite tunes Lova Lova, All Over, and Ma Lo featuring Wizkid & Spellz, you should polish up your afro-beat dance moves and wear your favourite kicks because second of her on the breathtaking stage will be a wololo. On Saturday, 21 September festival goers will celebrate 25 years of Kalawa Jazmee Records on the Delicious Main Stage. This record label has not only defined culture these last 25 years, but its music and artists have played an integral role in each of our South African lives. South African's always knew what time it is with Boom Shaka, and they boldly told abuti to "bula boot" with Thebe. There are memories of Uhuru, Mafikizolo, Brothers of Peace, and so many more of the Kalawa Jazmee Records' artists ingrained in the identity held as a nation, and as individuals. Other carefully handpicked performances on the Delicious Main Stage on Saturday, 21 September are the Ralf Gum All-Stars featuring Monique Bingham, Mafikizolo, Kafele Bandele, Portia Monique, Ayanda Jiya, Bongi Mvuyana, Joseph Junior, and Nivalito.

Headlining the show on Sunday 22 September is the phenomenal artist with a deep contemporary creative vision - the epic singer, songwriter, guitarist and producer Raphael Saadiq. With an impeccable past of multi-faceted creation and soul-evolution, this hugely gifted musician will no doubt pull on your heartstrings.
