Ruhindi North County MP Thomas Tayebwa has called on all schools across the country to adopt physical fitness lessons on the schools' curriculum in order to embrace a healthy living. Speaking as a guest of honour during the annual sports day celebrations of Mt St Mary's College Namagunga in Mukono District on Saturday, Mr Tayebwa said physical activities roll out holistic students who compete favourably in our day-to-day society. The MP noted that lack of exercise has, however, led to obesity and other related diseases. "Through games and sports, the body becomes physically active, an aspect that is important to every student," Mr Tayebwa said. Last year, the National Curriculum Development Centre and government overhauled the O-Level curriculum, dropping or merging 23 subjects, and approving only 20 to be taught. The physical education subject was among those upheld. Government said the reviewed curriculum would be rolled out in 2020. Physical education lessons entail sports activities such as football, netball and athletics, among others, which involve using physical body parts for practice. Doctors say this helps in developing students' brains and mental strength. Dr Solomon Taremwa, a psychiatrist from Medicare Hospital in Ntinda, Kampala, said most diseases related to body organs such as the brain, liver and kidney have everything to do with lack of body fitness. Ms Regina Nabawanuka, the headmistress of Mt St Mary's College Namagunga, thanked the sponsors and government for supporting sports in the school. "We have been participating in national competitions and we have been performing well, this is reflected in our academic performance. I thank the government for always giving us a conducive atmosphere," Ms Nabawanuka said.
