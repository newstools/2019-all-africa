Cape Town â€” Channel24 has learned that M-Net (DStv 101) has acquired the upcoming parody-drama series, BH90210, that reunites on-screen the former cast of the 1990's American drama series Beverly Hills, 90210. The new series, produced by CBS Television Studios and distributed by CBS Studios International, will start on 7 August in the United States on FOX, although an exact broadcast starting date for the revival-series on M-Net in South Africa isn't yet known. The original series' Gen X stars - Jason Priestley, Shannen Doherty, Jennie Garth, Ian Ziering, Gabrielle Carteris, Brian Austin Green and Tori Spelling - will all appear, playing heightened versions of themselves, inspired by their real lives, as they try to get a new version of their former TV show off the ground. FOX gave the new Beverly Hills, 90210 a straight-to-series commission almost three decades after the original series that ran for a decade was broadcast on the SABC's TV1 until the broadcaster couldn't afford it and it jumped to M-Net. A shortened five-season 90210 with a new cast also aired on M-Net a few years ago until its cancellation in 2013. Now the original stars will be back, all also serving as executive producers. Carol Potter, who played mom Cindy Walsh and Christine Elise who played Emily Valentine, will also make guest appearances in the series that has an initial 6-episode order. Source: Channel24
