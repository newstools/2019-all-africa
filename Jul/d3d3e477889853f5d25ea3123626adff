Johannesburg â€” SEACOM, the submarine communications cable operator, is marking ten years of the launch of Africa's first private high-speed subsea cable system laid along the eastern and southern coastlines. It launched the system on July 23 in 2009. Each year on the day, the connectivity provider commemorates the occasion by engaging in projects which help to uplift the communities in which it operates. Held under the aegis of the Foundation Day, the main commemorations are in South Africa where corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives have been conducted in Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg. Similar initiatives have been held in Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique and Tanzania. Byron Clatterbuck, SEACOM Chief Executive Officer, said the company traditionally celebrated Foundation Day by participating in social responsibility and charity projects because it wanted to contribute towards making Africa a more prosperous and connected continent. "It's our way to thank the community for being part of our journey and to give something back," he concluded. SEACOM has over the years increased the availability of international bandwidth ten-fold, and especially in many of Africa's most under-served nations. Its reach extends into Europe and the Asia-Pacific.
