Nairobi â€” President Uhuru Kenyatta has told investors to buy locally available materials for the construction of housing using units in the country. The head of state said he will not allow the importation of materials for housing projects which can be manufactured and purchased locally. "I will not allow investors to bring into the country construction resources that are already here," Kenyatta said. He further highlighted that the move is aimed at creating employment opportunities for the youth. "We have young people in different parts of the country who are able to make these materials, let us support them so that we can bridge the jobless gap among our young people," the head of State added.
