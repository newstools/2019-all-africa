Accra â€” The new Global Corruption Barometer - Africa 2019, released on African Anti-Corruption Day by Transparency International and Afrobarometer, reveals that more than one in four people who accessed public services during the previous year had to pay a bribe. A majority of citizens surveyed in 35 African countries think that corruption is getting worse and that their government is doing a poor job of fighting it, the report indicates. The 10th edition of the GCB-Africa, based mainly on Afrobarometer's Round 7 surveys, is the largest and most detailed survey of citizens' views on bribery and other forms of corruption in Africa. The report, available here, is the eighth in Afrobarometer's Pan-Africa Profiles series on its most recent survey findings. The report also highlights that corruption disproportionately affects the poorest citizens, who have to pay bribes twice as often as the richest to access public services such as health care and police assistance. Young people pay more bribes than their elders. Key findings: About the GCB The Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) - Africa survey was implemented by Afrobarometer in 34 countries as part of its Round 7 surveys, in collaboration with Transparency International. A separate survey for the Democratic Republic of Congo was commissioned by Transparency International and conducted by Omega Research. The surveys were conducted face-to-face using computer-assisted personal interviewing with 47,105 adults aged 18+ living in 35 countries in Africa. The fieldwork was conducted between September 2016 and September 2018, and the surveys were sampled and weighted to be nationally representative. The overall results for Africa are equivalent to an average of the countries surveyed. For more on the survey methodology, please visit www.afrobarometer.org.
