Victoria Falls â€” The medical regulatory authorities have been urged to address the challenges of affordable healthcare to the general public and ensure access to medication to realise Vision 2030, Minister of Health and Child Care Dr Obadiah Moyo has said. In a speech read on his behalf by Health Services Board chairperson Dr Paulinus Sikhosana at the 23rd Association of Medical Councils of Africa (AMCOA) annual conference in Victoria Falls, which ended at the weekend, Dr Moyo called for affordable healthcare at all levels. "Government also expects regulatory authorities to address the challenges of affordable healthcare to all. "Our people at the grassroots must be able to afford quality healthcare services in as much as the medical professionals are expected to keep afloat. "The issue of exorbitant medical and drug fees must be addressed if we are to realise our Vision 2010 goals," said the minister. The call comes after most pharmacies in Zimbabwe are charging prices of medication in foreign currency or equivalent to local currency, which is beyond the reach of many. He added that the role of the regulator in the achievement of universal health coverage can also not be undermined. "The various medical associations in their capacity as regulators should enhance their operations, share views and exchange information on matters of common concern and liaise with each other in regard to the standards for registration of medical practitioners" he added. The conference, Dr Moyo said, will facilitate cooperation and collaboration among regulatory authorities and encourage research, policy analysis and development related to medical regulatory authorities, He also called for the need to share new concepts and approaches in the regulation of medical practice. Health experts drawn from health associations of medical councils of Africa and beyond attended the conference which was organised by the Health Professions Authority and Medical and Dental Practitioners Council of Zimbabwe
