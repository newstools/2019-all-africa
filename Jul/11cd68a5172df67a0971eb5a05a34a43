The ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities in conjunction with the Uganda Tourism Board have launched the sixth edition of the Miss Tourism beauty pageant. Speaking at the launch at Sheraton hotel last week, Bradford Ochieng, the deputy CEO, Uganda Tourism Board (UTB), said, "Apart from just promoting the tourism sector, this undertaking also brings the girl-child to the limelight." The occasion also doubled as a tribute to Miss Tourism 2017 Anita Ayebare, who came fourth out of 54 countries at the recent Miss Tourism World event in Croatia. According to UTB CEO, Lilly Ajarova, "Our ambassadors are doing a great job. They have made Uganda visible on the international occasions in Croatia. The youths are picking interest in tourism. Their participation and application to contest are testimony." This year's competition is under the theme, 'Celebrating Uganda's Cultural Diversity', and will see a number of contestants representing the 11 target tourism clusters. Auditions have already kicked off in different clusters. All contestants will undergo a rigorous training and a three-week boot camp aimed at equipping finalists with knowledge about tourism, conservation and prepare them as tourism ambassadors. The grand finale will be held on October 4, 2019 at Kampala Serena hotel.
