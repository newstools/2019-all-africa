Morning commuters escaped unhurt on Tuesday morning after their matatu was hit by a cargo train in Embakasi. The accident occurred at around 11am at the Avenue Park Estate junction. No casualties were reported, but the KBS bus was severely damaged. In February, a similar accident happened at the same spot when a commuter train rammed into a Citi Hoppa bus. No casualties were reported in the incident. In 2018, a train hit an oil tanker near Pipeline Estate in Nairobi leading to a major traffic snarl up on Outer Ring Road which left one person injured.
