Cape Town â€” Hey, Upper East Siders, Gossip Girl here. Rumour has it that your favourite show is getting a reboot. Yours truly will fill you in on the scandals and personal lives of a whole new generation of New York private school students. HBO has ordered a 10-episode series that will premiere on Warner Bros new streaming service, HBO Max. What's the dish on the new show? Well, it will take place eight years after it was revealed that Lonely Boy was behind the original website. The new series will show just how much social media and the landscape of New York has changed since then. In case you forgot the show ran for six seasons on the CW from 2007-2012 and launched the careers Blake Lively, Leighton Meester, Penn Badgley, Chace Crawford and Ed Westwick.
