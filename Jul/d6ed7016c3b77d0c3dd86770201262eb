Young runway and commercial model, Akua Aseda, is set to feature on the upcoming maiden edition of the Meraki fashion show by popular celebrity designer Sima Brew. It is aimed at showcasing costumes made by students of the highly acclaimed Sima Brew Fashion Business Faculty. The fashion show, according to organisers is "inspired by the art of doing something with total love and soul, leaving a little piece of yourself in your creative works". Despite being at a very tender age, the 8-year-old has already partaken in various international fashion shows and is currently one of the ambassadors of golden chocolate. She has become a force to reckon with when it comes to modelling in the country and beyond. Akua Aseda, who began her modelling career recently, has impressed fashion lovers with her versatility, elegance and her constant promotion of Ghanaian products and preserving the country's core values through fashion and entertainment. During Ghana's 62nd Independence Day celebration, Akua underwent a free promotional photoshoot, dressed in the rich Ghanaian Kente to show patriotism and portray the rich culture of the country. Known to take up leading modelling roles both on the runway and as one of the most sought after brand ambassadors for leading businesses in Ghana, management of the fast rising model promised to steal the Meraki fashion show. In June this year, Aseda after partaking in the maiden Ghana Kids Fashion, emerged as one of the best models with elegance. She is gradually selling Ghana to the rest of the world with her talent, just like her colleagues DJ switch and Nakeeyaat, who recently won the talented kids show on TV3.
