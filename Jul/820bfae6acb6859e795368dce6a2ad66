The Nigerian Army has said that Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai is still the Chief of Army Staff and that any contrary information is baseless and should be disregarded. The Arny in a statement said on Tuesday that the news that Lieutenant General LO Adeosun has been appointed as Chief of Army Staff of the Nigerian Army is fake news. The Army said in the statement by Colonel Sagir Musa, Acting Director Army Public Relations, that Lieutenant General LO Adeosun was granted special promotion by the President, Commander -in - Chief, of the Armed Forced of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari for his extra ordinary feats, exemplary leadership, loyalty and uncommon commitment and was communicated to him by the Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen TY Buratai. Contrary to fake news going round insinuating or suggesting appointment of Lieutenant General LO Adeosun as Chief of Army Staff of the Nigerian Army, members of the public are hereby once again informed that Lieutenant General LO Adeosun has just been given special/accelerated promotion from Major General to Lieutenant General and formally communicated to him by the Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen TY Buratai. Lt Gen LO Adeosun is only granted special promotion by the President, Commander -in - Chief, of the Armed Forced of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari for his extra ordinary feats, exemplary leadership, loyalty and uncommon commitment in the counter insurgency operation in the North Eastern part of Nigeria. He still retains his appointment/position as Chief of Training and Operations of the Nigerian Army. Any contrary information is baseless, fake news and should be disregarded.
