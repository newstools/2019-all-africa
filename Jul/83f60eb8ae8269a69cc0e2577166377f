They say age aint nothing but a number, but sometimes it is, especially when it is concealed. It has been revealed that socialite Zari Hassan aka the Boss Lady is about 12 years older than the Bongo Flava crooner Diamond Platinumz. This was recently revealed after her passport was leaked by unknown people. Images of the passport show that Zari was born on September 23, 1978. This means the mother of five will be turning 41 in the next two months. When the Zari was dating Diamond Platnumz's who is 29, she would say that their age difference was not more than 10 years. However, she never revealed her real age besides saying she was still in her 30s.
