This saw the Kenyan pugilist stretch his record to 4 wins (2kos), 2 loses and a draw while the Michigan based Austion dip to 10 (7kos) -2-0.

Okoth shocked the boxing world in June, when he defeated Irish welterweight sensation, Dylan 'The Real Deal' Moran (then 10-0 5 KO's) at Resorts World Catskills, in Star Boxing's 'Catskills Clash.'

Smelling blood in the water, Okoth did not take his foot off the gas, dropping the Irishman two more times in the third round to earn the ABO title. This regional title fight will be 8 rounds.
