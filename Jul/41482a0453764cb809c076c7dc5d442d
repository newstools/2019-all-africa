Cape Town â€” Officials in the DR Congo have confirmed that a pastor diagnosed with Ebola in Goma has died, appealing for calm as the epidemic reaches the city with a population of one million people, according to France24. "Unfortunately, I can confirm that the patient died," North Kivu Goveror Carly Nzanzu Kasivita, said today. Goma borders the Rwandan town of Gisenyi. The World Health Organization (WHO) described the case as a "potential game-changer". "Goma is a warning," the World Health Organization's emergencies chief, Mike Ryan, said in Geneva.
