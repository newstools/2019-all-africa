Abuja â€” The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) will this morning picket the house and office of the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, over non-inauguration of the board of Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF). The NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, who disclosed this in Abuja yesterday, said labour movement in the country abhors the ways Ngige is administering industrial relations, social dialogue and tripartite consultation on ad-hoc basis. He said the labour movement would meet Ngige headlong since he has deployed public resources to deny workers of a representation on the board of NSITF. "We will make the industrial space very uncomfortable for him as we will picket him anywhere we see him," he said. Wabba said the labour would continue to resist Ngige perpetuating himself as the sole administrator of NSITF four years after the last board was dissolved. The NLC chief also alleged that the minister had employed ethnicity in his attempt at preventing the inauguration of the board. Meanwhile, the minister has continued to insist that he has the approval of President Muhammadu Buhari to redeploy Kokori to the Michael Imodu National Institute of Labour Studies, Ilorin, Kwara State where he will bring his expertise to bear in the training of unionists. Ngige then named Mr. Austine Enajemo-Isere as the new chair of the NSITF board. As the confusion continues, both the Presidency and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, have remained silent. Wabba said that the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, told him during the May Day celebration in Abuja, which Ngige did not attend, that the chair of the NSITF remains Kokori.
