Kampala — ANTI-CORRUPTION agencies in the continent have called on foreign governments to speed the repatriation of assets stashed in their territories mostly by former African leaders. Some African politicians are notorious from plundering their countries resources and banking the proceeds from corruption on offshore accounts. Anti-graft heads meeting at a just-concluded conference held in Uganda called for the prompt repatriation of the assets to African countries from Europe, the United States and other jurisdictions. The ninth Commonwealth Conference of Anti-Corruption Agencies in Africa was held in the capital Kampala under the theme, "Time to Act: Prevent Corruption for Sustainable Development." The next edition will be held in Rwanda next year. In a communiqué issued after the meeting, the heads of anti-corruption agencies in Africa requested the heads of Government in Europe, America and other jurisdictions to work towards the speedy and unfettered repatriation of recovered assets to African countries. Ibrahim Magu, the Chairman of the Association of Anti- Corruption Agencies in Commonwealth Africa, said there was a need to strengthen cooperation and collaboration among the anti-corruption agencies in Commonwealth Africa for purposes of facilitating asset recovery and return. Magu is also the chairman of the Nigeria Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Switzerland in 2017 announced it would return US$1 billion looted by the now-late military leader of Nigeria, Sani Abacha.
