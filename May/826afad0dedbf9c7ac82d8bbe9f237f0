Dr Ndugulile was responding to a question by Kaliua MP, Magdalena Sakaya (CUF) who sought to know when the government would implement the free health services policy to expectant mothers, under-five children and the elderly above 60 years. She sought to know the number of districts where the special IDs were released to enable the special groups to access free health services since 2014 when the exercise started. Mr Ndugulile said there were still challenges in implementing the policy due to increase of diseases and people in special groups.
