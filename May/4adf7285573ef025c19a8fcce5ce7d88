G7 development aid must prioritize the needs of women and girls if they are to tackle poverty and economic inequality, said Oxfam today as G7 Ministers prepare for a meeting on gender equality in Paris on the 9th and 10th May. The G7 accounts for three quarters of total international development aid. Robin Guittard, Senior Campaigner on Financing for Development said: "Putting women and girls at the heart of the development agenda is key to fighting poverty and inequality - yet just US$97 million of the US$110 billion the G7 spent on overseas aid in 2017 was channelled through women's organizations. President Macron, who is hosting this year's G7 Summit, has made gender equality a priority at home but less than one third of its overseas aid funding is targeting women." "G7 leaders must commit to a feminist development agenda - including more funding for women's organisations in developing countries and more funding for public services which benefit women and girls such as healthcare and education," added Guittard.
