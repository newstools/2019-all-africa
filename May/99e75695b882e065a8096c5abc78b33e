The 'Dundaing' hit maker rubbed shoulders with some high-profile celebrities across the globe at the 72nd edition of the Cannes Film Festival. The rapper could not wait to share pictures on social media. "History is made. First Kenyan musician to grace the red carpet in 72 years," he claimed. He also shared another picture with American singer Selena Gomez. "That's me and Selena Gomez. Dedicating this post to all Kenyan girls. Believe you are strong, believe you are capable and believe anything is possible. Inspiration from Selena Gomez for each one of you." Ohh That's me and @selenagomez .
