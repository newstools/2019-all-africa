Lupita Nyong'o turned heads last night as she attended the Christian Dior Couture S/S20 Cruise Collection in Marrakech, Morocco. The Kenyan-Mexican actress looked 0h-so-gorgeous in a chic and simple Dior ensemble which was a black 'toile de Jouy' embroidered tulle skirt married to a glossy jacquard shirt from the Autumn-Winter 2019-2020 collection by Maria Grazia Chiuri.
