To celebrate World Press Freedom Day and the 'Global Conference for Media Freedom' (DefendMediaFreedom), to be hosted by the Governments of the United Kingdom and Canada in July 2019, The British Embassy Mogadishu is delighted to announce the launch of Young Somali Voices journalism prize (YSV). We are seeking short videos and photographs from media students and early career journalists based in Somalia including which demonstrate a positive, original and unique story about Somalia. This award will highlight the importance of defending media freedom and demonstrate the key role that the media play in creating an inclusive and open society in Somalia. It will also seek to identify and project young Somali voices including Somaliland and positive stories about Somalia. The new prize was announced during World Press Freedom Day celebrations held at the British Embassy Mogadishu and co-hosted by Her Majesty's Ambassador to Somalia, Ben Fender, and representatives from the United Nations office in Somalia. The event provided a platform for a cross section of Somali journalists to raise awareness of the challenges and opportunities they face with regard to media freedom in Somalia. Speaking after the event, the British Ambassador to Somalia said: "A free press is our best defence against corruption, extremism and abuse of power. Media freedom is under increasing attack in Somalia as journalists are rroutinely subjected to intimidation, harassment and persecution. I look forward to continuing our work with the media, civil society organisations, international partners and the Government of Somalia to address these challenges together.
