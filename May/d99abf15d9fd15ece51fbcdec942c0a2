Actress Tonto Dikeh has given a reveal-all interview to Daddy Freeze to clear the air on her broken marriage to Olakunle Churchill. The interview is her chance to lay bare her relationship with the separated father of her son, who is mentioned in her chat. It begins with her admitting to starting a new but "celibate" relationship with someone from whom she is separated by both "religion" and "ocean." The interview proper begins with her telling how she met Churchill: at a club after her relationship with "Mr X" broke up. Mr X remains unnamed, just a moniker she gave to the unmentioned man because it wasn't certain where the relationship was headed. Prompted by a comment from Daddy Freeze about Churchill being calm, Tonto said her ex's calm is the only thing that impressed her. "That's the only I'm impressed, because he is a good liar. He's very calm and calculating, like a demon, he does not need to shout," Tonto said. "He's like, 'I'm just going to sit down and mess you up. I'll say this in the press, I know that you will react like a mad person.' That's the only place I'm impressed, because he gets his shit together somehow. But I am here to bust it." And with that she revealed sheaf of papers--documents, receipts to back up the claims and counterclaims that have rocked her marriage to Churchill.
