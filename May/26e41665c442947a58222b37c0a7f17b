In a tweet, Skales slammed the presidential aide and his family by wishing the experiences that common Nigerians face with the police, The singer tweeted, "And this idiot @BashirAhmaad why are you not tweeting about this dumb police. I grew up in the north like you but you don't have any feelings and I wish you everything that's happening to the average citizen. I really pray it happens to you or one of your relations so you understand how we feel." Interestingly, Ahmad replied Skales callout and wrote back, "Part of the price of being a public servant; anyway, I wish my family, your family and family of every Nigerian well. As you prepare to release your new single, all the best! #smile." It would be recalled that there was a renewed call by Nigerians to end the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) after one of its operatives shot dead a Nigerian identified as Kolade Johnson. Johnson was hit by the bullet while watching a football match at a viewing centre.
