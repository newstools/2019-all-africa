NTV will celebrate its 20th birthday in style next month as a news and entertainment hub by playing a huge role in the organization of the Tomorrow's Leaders Festival concert. The concert will bring to town international stars, including Alaine, Yemi Alade, J Boog, Stonebowy and Diamond Platnumz. The concert, put together by Jamaican Grammy Award winning reggae band Morgan Heritage, will also kick start the world tour of the group's latest album Loyalty. The event will also be a good opportunity for NTV, who will be the official media sponsor, to celebrate its 20th year of existence. The TV station was started in 1999 as Nation TV before it re-branded to NTV on April 4, 2005. GUEST ARTISTES Speaking on Thursday during the signing of the partnership deal with Morgan Heritage, Managing Director Nation Broadcasting Division Alex Kobia thanked the viewers for their support over the years. "We are pleased to be part of this festival in this special time when NMG is celebrating her 60th anniversary and interestingly NTV turns 20 years too - 20 years of informing and entertaining Kenyans," Kobia said. "We shall continue engaging with partners like Morgan Heritage to ensure that we not only give you the best in entertainment but also add value to your lives," he said. Other artistes who are expected to perform at the festival - which will be held at the Moi International Sports Center, Kasarani - are Jua Cali, Femi One, Wyre, Naiboi, Jose Chameleone, Jemere Morgan, Rophnan and Stanely Enow.
