Kenya and the United Kingdom will remain strong business partners even after the impending Brexit, British Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Secretary Jeremy Hunt said in Nairobi Friday. Mr Hunt said the two countries will protect their trading relations regardless of the manner in which Britain will exit the European Union, calming fears of business losses should London fail to secure a deal. "We see Kenya as key partner in this region and I would still want to reassure the country that trade is a key aspect of our relationship," Mr Hunt said. "We will still be able to maintain the same relationship even post a Brexit," he added. The official, who is on a regional tour, is expected to hold meetings with trade stakeholders as he continues his working trip in the continent. Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma echoed Mr Hunt's position that Kenya had nothing to fear. "There is nothing to fear. We have had repeated assurances from the highest levels and trade between the two countries is really an issue between London and Nairobi," Ms Juma said.
