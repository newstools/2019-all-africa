Last Saturday's listing of MTN Nigeria shares on the Premium Board of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) has made it possible to identify the shareholders of the telecoms firm. Many Nigerians believed the Nigerian government owned part of the South African firm through an unspecified equity holding by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).

New Status With the listing of the company's shares on the NSE, MTN Nigeria becomes the first privately owned telecoms company in Nigeria to attain that status. The listing of the company on the premium board of the NSE on April 18, 2019 resulted in the change of the company from a private company to a publicly quoted telecoms company on the NSE. MTN Nigeria, a subsidiary of MTN International (Mauritius) Limited, was incorporated in the Republic of Mauritius, with its ultimate holding company, MTN Group. The company was incorporated in November 8, 2000. But, it did not commence operations until 2001. Since then, the company has remained in operations for almost 18 years in Nigeria. MTN Nigeria is reputed to be Nigeria's largest telecoms operators, with about 67 million subscribers, controlling about 39 per cent mobile market share.
