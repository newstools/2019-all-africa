Nairobi musician-cum-promoter Bradley Juma Obomi aka Trap King Chrome is in the news again after UK singer Melesha Katrina O'Garro, known professionally as Lady Leshurr, called him out for trying to extort money from her. According to Lady Leshurr, Trap King Chrome has been trying to sell her unreleased music video. Trap King Chrome attracted unwanted attention in 2017 when he was arrested for allegedly pushing his British girlfriend from their sixth floor apartment in Lavington. The British rapper, who in January incurred the wrath of Kenyans for stating that she may not be visiting Kenya because of the terror attacks, says that Trap King Chrome, who was her promoter in the country, shot a video while in Kenya and that he is trying to extort her or he leaks it. "The same guy that brought me to Kenya for the Backyard Bass show in February 2019 at the Muze Club in Westlands, Nairobi has been trying to sell my unseen music video for my song Pretty Likkle Ting which I shot during my stay in the country." Remember when I went to Kenya for a show? The same guy who booked me is the same guy trying to extort me & sell an unseen music video I shot there 💀 he even tried to sell it back to me for 5K 😂😂🤦🏾‍♀️ wow Kenya ur elite level of finesse -- STREAM HORRID NOW 😈 (@LadyLeshurr) May 21, 2019 'LEAKED VIDEO' The 29-year-old rapper is best known for her Queen's Speech series of freestyles, the fourth of which went viral in 2016 and has a song in which she featured Mr Eazie called Black Madonna. She further claims that Trap King Chrome must have gained access to the video thanks to his friendship with a music director who was involved during the shoot. Leshurr says Bradley tried selling her the video for Sh640,000 (£5,000) but she ignored him and that Trap King Chrome has since been trying to leak the music video. She recounted how she performed alongside Grammy Award-winning rapper Nicki Minaj in Manchester in March saying that before she got on stage she got an email about the yet to be released music video leaking, something that killed her energy. The tweets also allege that the underground rapper wants to bring two more Grime artistes, Stormzy and J. Hus to Kenya for shows.
