Nairobi â€” The office of the United Nations High Commissioner (UNHCR) based in Westland has come out to absolve itself from any wrongdoing following a scuffle last week between security officers and refugees. The refugees were protesting delayed services by the agency when they were roughed up by security guards, resulting to deployment of police officers who lobbed teargas to disperse them. UNHCR head of unit in charge of Risk Management, Compliance and Quality Robert Hurt says it was up to police to determine how to restore order, saying not even refugees are not above the Kenyan laws. Some refugees have accused the agency of failing to remit their monthly financial support but Hurt says some don't meet the criteria. He has affirmed that only those who have met the criteria will continue receiving any help they're entitled while insisting they won't be bullied to submission, since it would means some refugees will be deprived of their rightful share of support.
