The Southwark Crown Court in the United Kingdom on May 1, 2019 sentenced Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange to 50 weeks (about 11 and half months) in jail for breaching bail conditions, the British Broadcasting Corporation, BBC, said. The 47year-old was found guilty of breaching the Bail Act last month after his arrest at the Ecuadorian Embassy. He took refuge in the London embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over sexual assault allegations, which he has denied. In a letter read to the court, Assange said he found himself "struggling with difficult circumstances." He apologised to those who "consider I've disrespected them." "I did what I thought at the time was the best or perhaps the only thing that I could have done," he added.
