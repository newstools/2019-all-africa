Maiduguri â€” THE Nigerian Army has slammed reports that suggest members of the Boko Haram terror group earn as much as US$3 000 (R43,100) daily in their violent campaign to overthrow the government. This is in comparison to the N1 000 (about R40) reportedly paid as allowances to soldiers daily. The comparisons were attributed to one Doctor Sidi Ali Mohammed, a member of the Presidential Committee on the North East Initiative. Colonel Sagir Musa, Acting Director of Army Public Relations, expressed the army's anger over the reports that have trended on social media platforms. "This is not true; it is a pure lie and highly irresponsible comment coming from a supposedly knowledgeable person of Mohammed's calibre," Musa said. "It is also criminal and preposterous to compare the gallant soldiers of our Armed Forces with the ragtag terrorists' criminal gang." Musa questioned Mohammed's knowledge of terrorists' earnings if he was not part of the group himself. The army spokesperson called on Nigerians to disregard utterances attributed to Mohammed while it reported him to authorities. He assured the public that the army remained resolute and focused in the fight against terrorism and insurgency. "No amount of distraction or terrorists' propaganda will dissuade it," Musa assured. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom (UK) has reiterated calls on the Boko Haram and Islamic State to release people kidnapped in Nigeria and neighbouring countries. Jeremy Hunt, UK Foreign Secretary, made the call during a visit to northeast of Nigeria.
