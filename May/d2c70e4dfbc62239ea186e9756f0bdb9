Several passengers at Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA), have been left stranded following major delays on Sunday afternoon. The delays, which the Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) are yet to address, have seen several passengers take to social media to inquire what could be wrong but with no response from the relevant authorities. Former NTV news anchor, Larry Madowo tweeted from the tarmac saying that they had been stuck there for over half an hour due to a total radar systems failure. Nairobi Air Traffic Control reportedly goes manual at JKIA after radar control system failure. Already been on the tarmac for 30min. Our captain says we're in a queue & only 1 plane took off in 10 minutes -- Larry Madowo (@LarryMadowo) May 5, 2019 @KenyaAirways We have been seated in this plane KQ 414 for an hour at JKIA waiting for jam to clear.
