Nairobi â€” Government Spokesman Cyrus Oguna says those who will have missed the registration exercise for the Huduma Namba will be able to do so at their respective local Assistant Chiefs Office. Oguna said there will be no extension to the exercise which ends in two days time. "After the 25th of May, registration for the Huduma Namba will be taken back to the local Assistants Chiefs. So anybody who will have missed to register now can then do so there." Oguna however noted: "The only problem with that is that the chief will have other responsibilities or commitments and may not give you priority." He urged the public to take advantage of the remaining days to register for the number. In the meantime, the government spokesman noted that after the deadline, they will embark on cleanup of data collected in the Huduma number exercise and individuals contacted for a fresh registration. "For those whose data will be required to be repeated, they will be communicated to go and register afresh at their respective Local Assistant Chiefs Office. " By the end of last week, President Uhuru Kenyatta who extended the exercise said 35 million Kenyans had been listed.
