New investments in coal-fired power infrastructure will hinder efforts towards a progressive, just energy transition to renewable energy with potentially huge losses for South Africa's public finances. We have a window of opportunity to stop this environmental suicide. On 1 July 2019, South Africans will be paying more for electricity when the recently approved 14% Eskom tariff hike by Nersa (the National Energy Regulator) is enforced. This hike is set to occur alongside rising food and fuel costs and will add financial pressure on South African households, hitting the poorest consumers the hardest.
