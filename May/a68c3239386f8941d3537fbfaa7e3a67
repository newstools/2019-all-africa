Johannesburg â€” South Africans are getting ready for the upcoming local TV show Uyajola 9/9. The show, which is reminiscent of US programme Cheaters and exposes infidelity in relationships, will be hosted by Jub Jub who was released from prison in 2017 after serving four years, one month, and one day behind bars. The local musician and his friend Themba Tshabalala were originally sentenced to 25 years for the death of four children after causing a serious accident when they were drag racing under the influence of hard drugs on a public road near a school. The 2012 murder conviction was eventually overturned and reduced to an eight year sentence in 2014. The disgraced musician previously hosted Uthando Noxolo on Mojo Love in 2018. Speaking about the show in a press statement, Jub Jub warned that it is "not for the faint-hearted". "I am very proud to be pioneering a show that is a very first of its kind in Mzansi. There is no doubt that cheating and infidelity are social ills that are wreaking havoc in South African communities, therefore my quest with this show is to shed light on the impact infidelity has on all affected individuals," the statement reads. "As you can imagine doing a show like this takes a lot of courage as you are dealing with people's lives and their pain on a daily basis. I'm telling you it's not for the faint hearted," he adds, saying that he is proud to be linked to a show that "sheds light on real issues South African people are dealing with." For those wondering what the purpose of the show is, Jub Jub says it is to "give answers". "I am a firm believer that once people have answers they are able to make informed decisions about themselves and their relationships moving forward." Uyajola 9/9 premieres on Moja Love (DStv channel 157) on Sunday 26 May at 21:00. Source: Supplied
