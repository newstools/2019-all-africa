Luanda â€” CHURCHES around the world are commemorating 400 years of the enslaving of African people in the United States of America (USA). The commemorations mark the forced transatlantic voyage of enslaved African people from Angola to the American state of Virginia. The World Council of Churches stated the policy and practice of enslaving Africans laid the foundations for the systematic disenfranchisement and disempowering of people of African descent for 400 years in the United States and around the world. "WCC celebrates the spiritual resistance of African people throughout these 400 years," the organisation stated. It affirmed the historic partnership that the churches and ecumenical organizations in the US shared with WCC in addressing the scourge of racism globally. "WCC affirms the timely relevance and significance of related ecumenical work, and invites WCC member churches to find opportunities to commemorate this historic moment in their churches." Current estimates are that about 12 million to 12,8 million Africans were shipped across the Atlantic over the span of 400 years. The number purchased by the traders was considerably higher, as the passage had a high death rate. Near the beginning of the 19th century, various governments acted to ban the trade, although illegal smuggling still occurred. In the early 21st century, several governments issued apologies for the transatlantic slave trade.
