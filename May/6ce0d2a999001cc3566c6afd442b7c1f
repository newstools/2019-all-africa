Kotido â€” More than 9,000 residents of Kacheri Sub-county in Kotido District are relieved after government installed piped water in the area. While commissioning the solar-powered project last Friday, Mr Richard Matuwa, the assistant commissioner in-charge of planning and development under urban water and sewerage services, appealed to residents to own the project. He said the Shs2.5 billion water project covers 11 villages in the sub-county. The project supplies 8,000 litres of water per hour. Mr Matuwa also urged farmers to also use the project for irrigation to increase agricultural production. He said residents who want water to their homes can pay Shs50,000 for connection and cater for water bills while other communities can use taps which will be constructed at every point. Ms Jennifer Nakong, a resident, said lauded government for the project. "We have been walking 10 kilometres to collect water at boreholes which are also shared with animals," Ms Nakong said. Mr John Nangiro, another resident, said the clean water will now improve their health. "We have been suffering due to lack of access to clean water. Our women and children would wake up very early morning and late at night to fetch water from the only single borehole whose level of water has reduced due to large population," he said. Mr Jacob Akudo, the sub-county chairperson hailed government for clean water, saying the crisis had contributed to domestic violence since many women were spending longer hours at the borehole. "The sub-county had many boreholes but many of them dried up due to drought leaving only two boreholes," he said. Water officials say it is hard to have boreholes in some places in Karamoja Sub-region due to limited technology because the area is rocky and, therefore, hard to drill through. [email protected]
