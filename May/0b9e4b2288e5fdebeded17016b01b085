Nairobi â€” Nairobi, Governor Mike Sonko has issued a new directive that will bar the county from outsourcing several services. Sonko ordered all county vehicles to be serviced at the multi-million-shilling Dandora Greenlight Vocational Training Centre. The County Government is currently outsourcing the service. The governor also directed all Nairobi County Government uniforms and flags to be procured at the same institution in order to cut costs and also benefit the facility. Speaking when he presided over the first graduation ceremony for the Dandora Greenlight Vocational Training Centre, Sonko said his administration will cut costs by sourcing for services from this institution. "From today, I want all Nairobi County Government vehicles to be serviced here in order to cut costs, and the money spent will therefore benefit this facility. All county uniforms including flags and ECDE uniforms will also be procured from Dandora," said Sonko. The governor also added that his government is committed in implementing programmes that will impart employable skills in youth, and to facilitate in the creation of employment and self-employment opportunities. "The Constitution of Kenya assigned the responsibility of management vocational training to County Governments. I wish to reiterate my governments' commitment to this noble obligation as highlighted in my manifesto 2017 which states that the County Government will invest in technical and vocational training," he stated. "My government recognizes the important role that the TVET sector plays in the economy and its potential in meeting the national goals of education." The Dandora Greenlight Vocational Training Centre was opened in 2017. The centre has established a car unit with digitized automobile diagnostic equipment and a garment making production unit which has impacted greatly in offering quality training.
