Nairobi â€” Former Government Spokesman Eric Kiraithe has been moved to the ICT Ministry to serve as the Principal Administrative Secretary. While giving his parting remarks during a press briefing, Kiraithe appealed to the media to always be balanced in its reporting of various issues. "You have been in my company for a very long time and maybe this will be the last time I will be dealing with you directly and what I would want to urge you is that as good partners, kindly, do not be in a hurry to broadcast unauthorized information," he stated. He previously served as the Kenya Police spokesman and Chief of Security at the Kenya Airports Authority (KAA). Kiraithe was replaced as Government Spokesman by Cyrus Oguna who has been serving in the military.
