Lisbon — The Energy Forum of Africa will host around 3,000 participants from 11 to 14 June in Lisbon, with several Energy Ministers from Portuguese-speaking countries, including Angola's Minister of Energy and Water, João Baptista Borges. According to a statement from EnergyNet, the organizing company, at the meeting it will be presented by the Prime Minister of Portugal, António Costa, the tender process for 1.35 GigaWatts (for 2019) and 700 MegaWatts (for the beginning of 2020) of photovoltaic projects. According to the site "The Observer", the forum, which returns to Europe after last year's meeting in Mauritius, beats a record of 18 ministers from various countries, as well as several secretaries of state and several senior governmental officials and numerous investors who have already confirmed their participation in this year's edition of the Africa Energy Forum. Cited on the statement, the director general of the event, Simon Gosling, said that the idea of holding the Forum in Lisbon "was warmly welcomed by the Government of Portugal, which continues to put partnerships, knowledge and technology transfer and economic opportunities firmly in the hands of those who are available to receive them". It has been gratifying, he said, especially since it is in a Portuguese-speaking country where large investments are being made in the natural resources and electricity sectors. Among the Portuguese-speaking governments, besides Portugal, it is confirmed the presence of the Sao Tome and Principe Public Works minister Osvaldo Abreu, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Energy of Cape Verde Alexandre Dias Monteiro, and the Minister of Energy , Industry and Natural Resources of Guinea-Bissau, António Serifo Embaló. The Africa Energy Forum welcomes a large number of public sector decision makers from all corners of the world, with about 46 per cent of Africans, with 21 per cent of all delegates being political leaders and legislators. "Angola, Mozambique, Côte d'Ivoire, Morocco, Nigeria, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa and Ethiopia will present their latest projects and investment opportunities in this closed networking environment that has gained a reputation for being not just the largest energy forum in Africa, but also the largest energy forum in the world", stressed Simon Gosling.
