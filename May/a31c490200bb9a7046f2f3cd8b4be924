The University of Cape Town (UCT) is hosting two separate and uniquely African exhibitions in the UCT Libraries and at the Irma Stern Museum as part of the institution's Africa Month celebrations. To mark the International Year of Indigenous Languages in 2019, UCT Libraries will focus specifically on African indigenous languages for its Africa Month displays, showcasing its relevant collections of archives, books, pamphlets, posters and films. The material can be viewed throughout May in various display cases in the Chancellor Oppenheimer Library Complex, including the main entrance, government publications, the foyer and the Jagger Reading Room. Films from the â€¡Khomani San - Hugh Brody Collection, generated during Brody's 15 years of work with the San of the southern Kgalagadi, are available for viewing in the Special Collections Reading Room for anyone who is interested. The complete collection includes 140 hours of original film, maps, GIS databases, family trees and transcripts of oral history collected in three different languages. Meanwhile, at the Irma Stern Museum, a contemporary exhibition titled Landskip and featuring landscape paintings by renowned artist Nicolaas Maritz, will be on display in the upstairs galleries for the duration of Africa Month. In a tribute to Stern's Zanzibar paintings, photographer Tessa Frootko Gordon's work showcasing Zanzibar will also be exhibited alongside Stern's art in the museum downstairs. The museum will host walkabouts on 17 and 21 May at 11:00.
