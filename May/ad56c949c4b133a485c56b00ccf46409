The ongoing Labour Day celebrations at Nairobi's Uhuru Park have attracted a low turn, with most workers seemingly uninterested in the annual fete. Images from Uhuru Park have shown only a handful of people in attendance with some holding banners seeking jobs. However, Central Organisation of Trade Union (Cotu) secretary general Francis Atwoli's invited VIP guests have all turned up. Labour Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yattani, Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka, ANC's Musalia Mudavadi and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula are among the high profile guests in attendance. LOW TURNOUT Online, Kenyans have attempted to explain the low turnout. "This is the lowest turnout Labour Day celebration in the history of this country. Atwoli hand over and retire honorably," wrote Harrison Njoroge. "I rather stay at home (sic) than go and listen to speech of Atwoli on Labor Day," stated Raymond Ngeno. "Uhuru Park is not filled to capacity because Kenyan workers are tired with ATWOLI (sic) fighting RUTO instead of fighting for their rights," Llyoid Boogie wrote. "Uhuru Park has like 100 people ðŸ˜‚ for #Mayday #LabourDay celebrations... Why would anyone want to be there?" Mbugua Macharia wondered. NOT INTERESTED "I am I only one while is watching empty Uhuru Park? Kenyans are no longer interested in fake lies of COTU, COTU lost its meaning when it joined politics," Fredrick Kavoo added. "As we celebrate Labour Day, there's just one question that lingers in my mind. Kwani COTU haina term limits or what. Francis Atwoli has been boss since 2001. We surely need fresh blood at this so important body," wrote Chris Mwangi. "I grew up knowing that Labour Day in Kenya is a day dedicated for Francis Atwoli to rant about how salaries and wages are low, unemployment and finally declare a national strike in two weeks... at the end of the day all will be forgotten and we'll go back to how we were ðŸ¤·," commented Jack Sylvester.
