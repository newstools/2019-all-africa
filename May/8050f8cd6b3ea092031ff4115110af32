In a bid to counter any threat posed by Ebola and other diseases, the EAC plans to organize a field simulation exercise (FSX) aims to assess the region's preparedness and response capacities. The exercise will take place at the Namanga border town next month and, according to the EAC secretariat, will mimic an outbreak of a major disease. About 250 people from both sides of the Tanzania/Kenya border are expected to participate in the day long exercise. "The event simulates an outbreak of an infectious disease from 11th to 14th June 2019 at the border between Tanzania and Kenya", the regional body said.
