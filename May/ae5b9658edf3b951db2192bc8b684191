Multiple award-winning Nigerian music star, Burna Boy has expressed sadness over Nigerian artists who are excited at the prospects of going international by signing deals with foreign record companies. The "Dangote" crooner took to his Instastories to warn such artists that they don't know what they are getting themselves into. In his post, the singer also expressed gratitude to his mother and manager for helping him navigate without the help of foreign record companies. He wrote, "I feel so sorry for all you Nigerians and artists jumping into these "international deals". You guys don't know what you're doing. I will forver be grateful to my manager/mother for making sure I will never be an "international" VICTIM. I feel very bad for every one of you. I'm hearing some really crazy shit out here. I feel so sad for you all."
