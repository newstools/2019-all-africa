Africa's leading marketing and public relations technology company, Plaqad.com has announced the release of the first-ever Big Brother Naija report. The Report which was released at the Nigerian Entertainment Conference held midweek provides valuable insights into the public perception of the reality TV show, its impact on the youth culture in Nigeria and its effect on the Nigerian economy. Big Brother Naija or BBNaija as it is more popularly called is a Nigerian reality television series based on the Big Brother television franchise. The show features 12 - 20 contestants who live in an isolated house and compete for huge cash prizes and gifts worth over $100,000 by avoiding eviction from the house by viewers of the show. While the show has remained popular especially with the young population, many have questioned the thinking behind it as well as its general impact on Nigeria's economy and youth culture. "While the popularity of BBNaija is never in doubt especially as it relates to its entertainment value, the direct and indirect impact of the show on youth culture and our economy is not as visible," said Gbenga Sogbaike, CEO of Plaqad. Among other exciting findings, the report revealed that Bisola Aiyeola, a 2017 contestant on the show, is the most loved BBNaija housemate ever. It also claimed that a majority of Nigerians believe the Big Brother Naija show is a more viable path to success than a university degree and a 9-5 job.
