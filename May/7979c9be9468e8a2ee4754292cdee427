Officials of the Kenya Maritime Authority (KMA) have rescued four crew from a capsized fishing boat Christened Qas-Wara in Lamu County. Speaking to the Nation in Lamu on Monday, County KMA Vessel Inspector Alexander Munga said they received reports from members of the public that a boat carrying four fishermen had capsized at Ras Kitau. "KMA together with the Kenya Maritime police and members of the public immediately embarked on a search and rescue mission which was successful. We managed to rescue all the four fishermen," said Mr Munga. The capsized boat was retrieved and towed to the shore and the victims taken to the King Fahad County Hospital for treatment. KMA, in partnership with the Maritime Police Unit in Lamu, is investigating the incident. STRONG WINDS Following the incident, the KMA has notified all mariners, fishermen, speedboat operators, pleasure crafts, passengers and the general public that strong winds and high waves are expected along the coastal waters this week. KMA Director General George Nyamoko Okong'o has advised all sea users to take extra caution when sailing and avoid venturing into the open sea during this period as the strong winds, waves and reduced visibility may cause loss of life and property through collision and capsizing of vessels at sea. HOTLINES "In case of any emergencies at sea or incidences, the public can contact the authority's regional maritime rescue coordination centre (RMRCC) through its emergency lines: 0721-368313 OR 0737-719414," the director general said in a statement. The incident comes just ten days after two people died while two others were rescued when a dhow they were using to ferry building blocks from Mokowe Jetty to Lamu's Pate Island capsized at the Mlango Wa Pate in Lamu East. The dhow was said to have capsized due to overloading.
