Maiduguri â€” THE Boko Haram terror group is carrying out more attacks outside Nigeria in its violent bid to establish as Islamic state in West Africa. More attacks have been recorded in neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger since the beginning of the year. In 2019, only half of violent activities associated with Boko Haram factions have been in Nigeria. The Armed Conflict Location and Events Dataset (ACLED) stated that the expansion of the violent activities into neighboring countries, and the types of violence it is engaging in, allude to a resilient and resourceful insurgency. It warned the increasing violence associated with Boko Haram had dire implications for the humanitarian crisis in the Lake Chad Basin and stabilisation efforts in the region. "So far in 2019, nearly half of all violent events involving the group have occurred outside of Nigeria - a proportion that is unusually high for the group," ACLED stated. The think-tank noted that Boko Haram's geographic pattern of activity in 2019 thus far resembles 2016, when almost 48 percent of the group's activities were outside of Nigeria. Since emerging in Borno State in northeast Nigeria in 2009, the vast majority of Boko Haram's violent activities have been concentrated in the country. Over 20 000 people have been killed and 2 million displaced. In the ten years the group has been active, more than 70 percent of violent events associated with the group and 80 percent of the associated reported fatalities have occurred in Nigeria.
