Coast Residents have been warned to brace for heavy rains starting Wednesday through to the weekend. According to a report from the Meteorological Department, rainfall of more than 30mm in 24 hours is expected over the coastal region from Wednesday to Friday, with increased intensity from Saturday and Sunday. The rains are likely to be accompanied by strong winds and may cause flooding in low lying areas near the coastline and other water repositories. The weatherman has urged residents of Kwale, Kilifi, Mombasa, Lamu, Taita Taveta and some parts of Tana River to be on the lookout for flash floods. The residents have also been cautioned against driving, wading or walking through fast-moving rain water. The heavy rains and strong winds may result in storm surges along the Coast, hence fishermen and those in the marine industry have also been put on high alert.
