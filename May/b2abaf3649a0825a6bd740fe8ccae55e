The award-winning record producer took to Instagram to share a thank you message which reads: Tonto Dikeh dumps Nollywood, turns Bible preacher "We will like to say a big thank you to all of our fans and business partners for the love and support through the years. "Mavin is seven today and I'm so proud of what we have been able to achieve. God has been faithful. We had some down times but I will be lying if I tell you I didn't learn a lot from those times. Those down times made me and the team stronger and wiser than ever. "I love and believe so much in my team. That being said, by the power vested in me, with so much fire in my belly, on behalf of the SUPREME MAVIN DYNASTY I say to every Mavin out there that #AllisInOrder."
