The 2019 Africa Shared Value Summit will this year bring business leaders and sustainability experts from across Africa to Nairobi. The summit will see delegates discuss the evolving role of business within a rapidly changing socio-economic landscape, and how businesses can integrate the Shared Value principles for inclusive and sustainable growth. The summit which brings together business thought leaders and change makers is aimed at raising awareness and advocating for the success of the strategic implementation of the Shared Value business model of profit with purpose. "Through the summit we hope to widen the Shared Value audience and bring together a broader African stakeholder group into the conversation. The reality is that governments alone cannot address the challenges that face the African continent. The summit will offer the private sector an opportunity to see how their business solutions, products and services can solve societal challenges while generating profit", said Bob Collymore, CEO, Safaricom. Though hardly new, the Shared Value concept has gained prominence in recent years as more businesses begin to question their role in improving livelihoods and uplifting communities. Shared Value is a management strategy in which companies find business opportunities in social problems through products addressing unserved or underserved customers, changing practices in the value chain to drive productivity and improving the available skills, supplier base, and supporting institutions in the communities where a company operates.
