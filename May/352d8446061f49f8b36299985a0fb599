The popular CMS bus stop in Lagos State has been featured in pop icon, Rihanna's latest campaign video for her luxury fashion brand, Fenty. The 45-seconds video begins with female models parading against a backdrop of thatched houses in a rustic setting. The ever-busy streets of Marina, Lagos Island, are also showcased for a few seconds in the video. The singer, 31, who originally hails from Barbados, is the first black woman in history to run a major luxury fashion house. The pop star had earlier announced her partnership with LVMH MoÃ«t Hennessy - Louis Vuitton SE, also known as LVMH, a French multinational luxury conglomerate. Along with Louis Vuitton, LVMH includes a number of high fashion houses, including Fendi, Christian Dior, Givenchy, and Marc Jacobs among others. Fenty is due to launch online on May 29. In a New York Times interview published on Monday, Rihanna said the plan for the brand was to be "disruptive" and change the luxury fashion world with a focus on direct-to-consumer online sales. The collection, which includes sunglasses, shoes and other accessories, will be expanded every few weeks. Check out the campaign video
