At least eleven civilians, many of whom pastoralists, were killed by members of the Afar regional state special forces, Mustefa Omer, president of Somali regional state confirmed to Addis Standard. Earlier reports came out from several individuals with family ties in the area indicating that the civilians were killed by members of the Liyu Police. Addis Standard reached out to Mustefa to confirm the information. "It is true," Mustefa said. Clashes between armed elements in Afar and Somali regional states have been recurring in recent months promoting protest demonstrations from both sides. 11 Somali pastoralists killed by Afar Liyu Police in Madane #Sitti Cige Faarax Adan Cige Faarax Cali Furre Faarax Cabdillaahi Ducaale Colle Axmed Ducaale Colle Boodhle Xalane Faarax Xuseen Jaamac Barre Sabban Geeddi Suge Cige Rooble Muuse Aadan Caateeye Dharaar Xuseen Dirir Cige pic.twitter.com/T6DoiiZdOf - Juweria (@BJuweria) May 3, 2019 According to Juweria Ali, a doctoral candidate in politics and international relations in London's Westminster University, yesterday's killing happened in Adayti, Undhufo,Garba-Issa, Dan-la-helay, Adayle and Madame areas under Afdam, Ma'ayso and Gablalu districts in Sit Zone.
