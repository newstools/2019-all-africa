Police in Somalia say former foreign minister Hussein Elabe Fahiye was among at least five people killed when a car bomb exploded Wednesday near the presidential palace in the capital, Mogadishu. At least 13 other people were injured. Militant group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the blast, saying they were targeting soldiers, lawmakers and other government officials. Al-Shabab frequently carries out bomb blasts in the capital near the presidential compound and at hotels frequented by government officials and foreigners.
