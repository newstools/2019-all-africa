The artists behind the controversial music video Pigwa Shoka have apologized to Kenyans over their newly-released song which has caused an uproar. The apology from the group Sheddy Empire comes in the wake of public outcry to have action taken against those behind the song's production. And on Sunday Kenya Films Classification Board (KFCB) chair Ezekiel Mutua also asked the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) to find and arrest the creators of the song. The song's video shows youths in "blood-stained" clothes carrying "bloody" axes in what appears to be an explicit campaign for the murder of women. HACKED TO DEATH In the apology video posted on YouTube one of the group members said: "We are here to apologize to the family of Ivy because of our song 'Pigwa Shoka'. If in any way tuliwakosea mahali, we never meant to hurt anyone." He went on to add that they just did the song"out of fun and creativity" The song comes just weeks after 28-year-old Naftali Njahi Kinuthia was arrested and charged for allegedly hacking Ivy Wangechi to death over unreciprocated love outside the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) on April 9.
