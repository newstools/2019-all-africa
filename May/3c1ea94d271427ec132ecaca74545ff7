Johannesburg â€” TV personality Simphiwe Ngema had only been married to Rhythm City star Dumi Masilela for a couple of months before his life had been tragically cut short following a botched hijacking in 2017. On Monday the actress paid tribute to Dumi, celebrating what would have been their second wedding anniversary, with two social media posts. In the first, Simphiwe shared a clip of herself performing at a gig on the weekend. "Hey Boongy, I feel like we need to catch up but anyway, happy 2nd year wedding anniversary. @dmasilela that's my performance from last Saturday. Just want you to know that it's not easy but I'm finding my way," she wrote. Source: The Juice
