Dakar — THE United Kingdom (UK) is funding a new £4 million (R74 million) English language programme in French and Portuguese speaking countries across African continent. Jeremy Hunt, UK Foreign Secretary, disclosed the initiative on his first tour of Africa. He will visit Ethiopia, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal. Hunt will visit Senegal first where he will launch the "English Connects" programme. Over the next two years, the programme will support the teaching and learning of English in sub-Saharan Africa countries where English is not widely spoken, with an emphasis on online learning. This British Council programme aims to reach 7,5 million young people each year. Hunt said the programme responded to the enormous appetite from young people across Africa to learn English to fulfill their potential. "Africa is a continent growing at an extraordinary rate, full of transformative potential," he said. "That's why we are providing new funding for English teaching to help many more young people access the possibilities that our language opens up, from London's financial powerhouse to our world renowned arts and culture." Hunt's visit follows the announcement last year that Britain would open new embassies in Chad and Niger. Britain would also expand its footprint in Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania and Senegal.
