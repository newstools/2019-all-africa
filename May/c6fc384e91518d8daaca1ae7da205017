Fans have slammed Afro-pop sensation, Burna Boy, for dismissing other artistes' YouTube successes. Burna Boy on Tuesday, claimed that musicians who have great views on the streaming platform are not necessarily 'talented.' The 'Dangote' crooner shared this on Instagram. The singer also said streaming numbers do not reflect a singer's "true worth or talent" and "no one should get carried away by them." "This streaming ... be making people feel like they are actually talented. If joke things like "Baby Shark" and "Gangnam Style" can do more number than everyone, don't think you are talented or respected because of your streaming numbers. "Everyone, with real working brains knows what a joke is and what is real. Anyway, plenty talk no dey full basket. Let time reveal all," Burna Boy's post read. Nigerians on Twitter have said the musician was simply taking a jab at his colleague, Mayorkun, who shared his achievement of attaining 70 million streams across different platforms hours earlier. Some persons also dug out a post by Burna Boy wherein he celebrated Gbona 7.5m YouTube views months earlier.

Is this necessary? pic.twitter.com/REhEJnlN2F - Zaddy Ajala (@UNCLE_AJALA) May 7, 2019 Burna doesn't care about numbers, he probably never has or he stopped very early in his career. All those social media posts appreciating fans for watching his videos or attending his shows bla bla bla is NOT Burna. Never has, never will. It's his PR team doing their job. - Bazinga! (@tolumoteni) May 7, 2019 I keep saying this; Nigerians are the type of people you'll die for and they'd still complain that you didn't die the way they like. Truth is bitter, Burna boy didn't name names but it hit hard. Call him whatever you want but if you call him overrated then you're a big FOOLish - GhostWriter üìùüëª (@MistAr_Juice) May 7, 2019
