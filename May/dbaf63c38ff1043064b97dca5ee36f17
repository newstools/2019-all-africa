Two farming communities in the Saboba district of the Northern Region, have been burnt in renewed communal violence clashes between the Chokosis and Komkombas. According to the police, the burning of the communities occurred in the early hours of Sunday, when some of the residents were said to be sleeping. The Northern Regional Police Public Relation Officer (PRO) Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Mohammed Yussif Tanko, who confirmed the incident to the Ghanaian Times, in an interview yesterday, said the clash was over farming land. The renewed clashes occurred a day after President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo admonished the two ethnic groups to end the frequent senseless violence, during his visit to the area. DSP Tanko said that there was nearly a clash in the area last Saturday, immediately the President left the district, as the combatants threatened to engage each in gun battle. He stated that a combine team of police and military managed to coiled the tension. The police PRO said, however, the combatants in early hours of Sunday sneak out and burnt the two communities. He maintained that no death has been recorded, and that the combine team of police and military rush to calm the security situation. DSP Tanko said no arrest had been made so far in connection with the burning of the communities. There have been intermittent violent clashes between the Komkombas and Chokosis in the Chereponi and Saboba districts for some time now. The conflicts had led to the burning of communities in the two district, which consequently resulted in death of several people. Some residents fled the area to neighbouring communities in the Republic of Togo.
