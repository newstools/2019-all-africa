"Isagoal" crooner, Naira Marley was arrested some few days ago by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on suspicions of connections with cybercrime. He was arrested alongside fellow singer, Zlatan Ibile and some others with the EFCC releasing a statement that it has ample evidence against Naira Marley and would charge him to court soon. They were arrested with some laptops seized from the house they were arrested in. On Tuesday night, Zlatan Ibile was released alongside Rahman Jago and two others while Naira Marley remained in detention. This move made Nigerians speculate that the evidence against Naira Marley must be a concrete one for him not to have been released. The statement read that the singer borrowed the laptop so he could upload music, record videos and work while he is in Nigeria. See the statement below; It would be recalled that when Naira Marley spoke about his arrest, he revealed that he is not new to getting arrested because when he was still based in England, he has been arrested at least 24 times. Naira Marley's arrest may not be unconnected to his recent support of cybercriminals popularly known as yahoo boys. In a social media post, he had said that the people need to pray for yahoo boys because they make money circulate in the economy. In another of such posts, he had responded to Nigerian songstress, Simi's criticism of yahoo boys. In his response to her, he had said that anyone who knows the history of slavery would know that there is nothing wrong with yahoo yahoo.
