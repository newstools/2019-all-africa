Netflix, the world's leading internet entertainment service, has just introduced Swahili subtitles to its TV and film services in Kenya. But just a few days later, it's evident that the translators at Netflix have a very poor grasp of Swahili. The subtitles in Swahili have largely been woeful, if not downright laughable and Kenyans on social media are now asking the paid channel to bring their inaccurate translation up to scratch. Netflix has more than 148 million paid memberships in more than 190 countries, enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can also play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Here is how Kenyans on Twitter have reacted to Netflix's horrendous Swahili translation: Dear @netflix. Please take off those horrendous Swahili subtitles. We speak and understand English in Africa. PS: Badass isn't "Punda mbaya" though. Your translators duped you big time. Thank you. -- Aisha Abdullahi (@X_trathoughtful) May 13, 2019 The Swahili Netflix subtitles are making me shuku every other foreign show I watch on there. What if all of them are nonsense? -- Naita Karauri (@Only1Naita) May 7, 2019 "Your partner was late, and he was high."
