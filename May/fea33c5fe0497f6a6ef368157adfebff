Kaduna —   –   As the conflict between farmers and herdsmen linger in Kaduna, the office of the Vice President, Proffessor Yemi Osinbajo has made moves to bring to an end the conflict between the fulani herdsmen and farmers in the affected communities This was through a peace meeting with the warring parties in order to end the lingering feud in the state. Those at the train-the-trainer workshop organised by the Vice President's office and funded by the Open Society Initiative For West Africa (OSIWA), were leaders of the Miyatti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Jama'atu Nasril Islam (JNI), representatives of traditional rulers, and community leaders. Dr Fatima Waziri-Azi, adviser to the   Vice President, said that the farmer-herders crisis has become one of Nigeria's gravest security challenges in recent times, adding   that the government has deployed more energy for the resolution of the crisis. According to her: "Although the crisis has been in existence for decades, it significantly worsened in 2014 resulting to many deaths.For many of us here, we know that farmers and pastoralists have had a long history of harmonious relationship". She also pointed out that peaceful coexistence has since been disrupted because of what is happening around the country Waziri-Azi explained that " it is against this background that the federal government in 2018 (a ten year plan) unveiled the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) from 2018 to 2027 as part of its strategy for tackling the crises in Zamfara, Kaduna, Benue, Maraba Plateau, Adamawa and Nasarawa States". She   said that the plan built by the government to address the conflict among the warring groups is built around several pillars, "We can see that the plan is encompassing and is designed to support government at all levels.It addresses peace and security, transformation and national growth and there are various entry points for all stakeholders to participate". She said the   leaders would be equipped with the necessary tools in engaging their communities in ensuring they live in peace and harmony. She added: "The conflict prevention and resolution pillar will support rebuilding relationships at the community level to promote mutual trust, confidence building and consolidation of the peace process".
