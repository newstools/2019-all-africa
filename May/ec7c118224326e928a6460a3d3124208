Maiduguri â€” NIGERIAN troops have rescued more than 50 hostages from Boko Haram terrorists northeast of the country. Some 29 adults and 25 children were freed during operations in a number of villages in the Borno State. They have been rescued under the military's Operation Lafiya Dole (Peace by Force) to eliminate the Islamic militants. "No encounter was made with the Boko Haram terrorists as they ran away before troops' arrival leaving behind 54 suspected kidnapped victims," said Colonel Sagir Musa, Acting spokesman of the Nigerian Army. Troops recently destroyed makeshift accommodation for suspected terrorists also in Borno state. Musa restated the Nigerian Army's resolution to ending terrorism and other forms of insecurities across the West African country. "We appeal to the public to continue to provide useful information about suspicious movement of terrorists and criminals wherever they are seen hibernating in Nigeria," he said. The Boko Haram is involved in a decade-long campaign to topple the Nigerian government and establish an Islamic state. More than 20 000 people have been killed and hundreds of others, including schoolchildren, have been kidnapped while more than three million people displaced.
