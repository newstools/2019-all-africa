Cape Town â€” South African singer Matthew Mole found his name on a 30 Seconds board game card, and he is pretty chuffed about it! Posting a photo of himself holding the card in front of his right eye, he writes: "Living the dream, baby." The singer from Cape Town shares the blue trivia card with Coca-Cola, The Disciples, Rush Hour and Brussels. If you're not familiar with the game, 30 Seconds, it's a board game where players play in teams, and one player must guess a word from their teammate's explanation, much like Charades. But they only have 30 seconds to answer! On fan on Instagram wrote a comment, saying: "That's when you know you've made it." Source: The Juice
