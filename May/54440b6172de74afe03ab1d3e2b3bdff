Abuja â€” Rising poverty, poor education and unemployment have been cited as major factors exposing youth to recruitment by the Boko Haram terror group in Nigeria. Civil society organisations said by failing to address these issues, political leaders were complicit in the illegal recruitment of the youngsters by the Islamist sect. "Politicians in the northeast region have leveraged religion as a tool to recruit the unemployed," said Isioma Nkemakolam, a researcher at the West African Network for Peace-building (WANEP). She was speaking at a workshop on countering violent extremism, held in the capital Abuja. "Such politicians have been complicit in the arming of Boko Haram," Nkemakolam said. She stressed the need to empower the youth to be economically independent. "When youths are gainfully employed, the chances of them being used as perpetrators of violence will greatly reduce," Nkemakolam said. She urged government to ensure perpetrators of violence by the Boko Haram are held accountable. "This should be done through the strengthening of judicial and legal processes." The Boko Haram has killed an estimated 30 000 people and displacing 2 million others over the past ten years. The violence has spread to neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger.
