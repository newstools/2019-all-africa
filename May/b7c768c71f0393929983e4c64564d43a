Mwanza â€” Public health officials have blamed ignorance of expectant mothers on the importance of going for early checkups and diagnosis to increased rate of child and pregnancy-related deaths in Mwanza Region. "Pregnant women who attend clinics from the first week undergo all the necessary tests and receive supplements that protects the child against infections including hydrocephalous and Spina bifida," said Ms Mwasham Mrisho, a nurse working with Impact project. Hydrocephalous is a condition caused by accumulation of fluid in child skull while Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the spine and spinal cord don't form properly. Health care providers from 27 health facilities in the region met this week during a five-day seminar organized by Impact Project which is funded by Aga Khan Foundation and the government of Canada. Ms Mwasham Mrisho said many pregnant women are ignorant of the need to attend health care services immediately after conceiving, urging them to avoid embracing traditional beliefs. "Children mostly die of anemia or eclampsia associated diseases which are partly caused by ignorance and mythical inclinations that embrace primitive ways of life especially in some communities, "she said.
