Assistant Superintendent of Immigration (ASI), Imam Mohammed Yahya Awal, has admonished Muslims to guard against terrorists, reiterating that terrorism has no place in Islam. He said it was anti-Islam for one to affirm the belief in Allah and the teaching of Islam as the religion that upholds the values of human dignity, and engage in any terrorists act. Delivering a Khutbah (sermon) at Jumah (Friday congregational) prayers at the Ghana Lebanon Islamic Senior High School Mosque in Accra on Friday, ASI Awal condemned in no uncertain terms people who took up arms and kill innocent humans being and associate that with Islam. "That is not Islam, this is not what Islam values, it is against Allah's will. Let us guard against this act and let that not be part of our religion,"ASI Awal told the congregation. ASI Awal admonished Muslims to uphold the values of Islam of peaceful co-existence with other faith and refrain from activities that were anti-Islam. The Imam called on Muslims to be wary of suspicious characters in their communities and expose them. He urged Muslims to take advantage of the month of Ramadan to pray to Allah to seek forgiveness and ask for his bounties, stressing that "Allah will continue to bless us so long as we put our trust and faith in him." ASI Awal advised the students to study hard and aspire to be useful to their family, community and the nation. The sermon of ASI Awal comes in the wake of terrorist alert in Ghana, following series of killings carried out by the so called Salafi Jihadist in neighbouring Burkina Faso.
