Residents of an apartment block in Ruaka woke up to the shock of their lives on Wednesday after a section of the car park sunk following night rains. Initial reports indicate that a developer had dug up a huge foundation next to Grafions Apartments on lane 26 without proper reinforcements. The rains swept away a chunk of Grafions Apartments' perimeter wall, sinking a car. No injuries have been reported.
