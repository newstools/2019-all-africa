Kenyan singer Akothee has lamented on the trauma she suffered on stage during a live performance in Oslo, Norway at the weekend. In a lengthy post on Instagram, Akothee narrated how rowdy fans grabbed at her person while others painfully spanked her derrière as she was performing. Akothee however seems to blame herself for taking to the stage without the security of her bodyguards. At some point, she says, she had to play hide and seek from a guy who got too aggressive. SECURITY "I think I forget myself at times, whom did I think I was to make a move without security though did I think I was in Turkana? The first time trying shit without security, not even my personal security NEVER EVER AGAIN that was TRAUMA, fan love is real, but it can get dangerous and overwhelming for an artist," said Akothee.

BROKE DOWN She says after the traumatic experience she broke down when she arrived at her hotel room. During her performance, Akothee wore one of her daring outfits of a white bikini cut bodysuit with brown heeled boots. In most of her performance, the mother of five is known for her explosive theatrics as she looks to impress her fans. For instance, while performing in Mombasa in February she left her fans speechless as she threw her legs apart while lying with his back on the ground.
