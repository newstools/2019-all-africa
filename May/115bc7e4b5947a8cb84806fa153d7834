National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi on Tuesday launched registration for Huduma Namba in the diaspora. Mr Muturi urged Kenyans in the diaspora to get listed to enable government account for its citizens living abroad. The launch of Huduma Namba abroad was held at the Kenyan embassy in Ukraine. Mr Muturi also asked the Foreign Affairs ministry to make it easier for Kenyans living abroad to register for e-passports. He said Kenyan students abroad might find themselves in a tight corner after the registration of e-passports ends in August 31. "The Director of Immigration Mr Gordon Kihalangwa has told me that plans are still underway to open more centers so that Kenyans living abroad register for e-passports," he said. This comes just a day after Interior CS Dr Fred Matiang'i said Kenyans living abroad had up to June 20 to register for Huduma Namba.
