A dance-off between Senator Millicent Omanga and K24 news anchor Betty Kyallo has left the latter red in the face with the legislator going all out in showing off her skills on the dance floor. A video that has been widely shared on social media captures Betty wearing a body con maroon dress while Ms Omanga donned a dazzling knee-length fitting dress.
