Johannesburg â€” She may not have had any luck with the Miss SA pageant, but that did not stop Tharina Botes from going on to become a pageant queen anyway. The model, who was a finalist in the 2018 Miss South Africa pageant, was crowned Miss Grand Phuket at a contest in Thailand. Tharina, who is half South African and half Thai, took part in the pageant in April and has now earned herself the title of Miss Phuket. "Love my new family!!! I came to Thailand barely knowing anyone, and now I have a whole family and to everyone supporting me, thank you so much from the bottom of my heart. I cannot wait to share this journey with you," a post from Tharina's Instagram page reads. Source: The Juice
