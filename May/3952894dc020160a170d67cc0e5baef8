"The lower the oil price, the higher the economic growth for the country. "It is very important for us to show that we can produce at less cost. And the only way we can continue to bring our cost down is when we have better technology. "Technology can only be seen to be better if it delivers results at a lower cost. And that is what I see here," Baru said. GMD expressed delight at the performance of Nigerian companies at the annual conference over the years.
