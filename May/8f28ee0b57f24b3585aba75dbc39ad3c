Grandpa Records has reopened its doors two months after burglars broke into the recording studio situated in Olympic estate, Kibra and made away with equipment worth Sh1.5 million. According to Grandpa Records CEO, Refigah, the new studio's office is now situated at Magiwa estate, Ngumo which will also house the label's new Public Relation Marketing, firm, Grandpa Dynamics. "After we lost our production equipment at our offices in Olympic we closed down business for almost two months. We were looking for a bigger and more secure space. We finally settled on Magiwa estate in Ngumo," Refigah told Nairobi News. "We have just reopened Grandpa Records and a new firm Grandpa Dynamics that deals in PR, marketing, branding and events. We are happy to be back bigger and better," he added. Even with the latest development, the burglars who broke into the premises are yet to be apprehended with the former rapper-turned-producer-cum-talent manager saying the suspect flew out of the country. "Like I told you, it was an inside job and the suspect was pursued until he couldn't hide anymore. He then decided to fly out of the country to avoid arrest," Refigah said.
