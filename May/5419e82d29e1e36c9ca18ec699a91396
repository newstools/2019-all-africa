DR. TERERAI TRENT Humanitarian, scholar, educator, and author, Dr Tererai Trent is one of the world’s most internationally recognized voices for quality education and women’s empowerment. Distinguished as Oprah Winfrey’s “All-time favorite guest”, Trent is a prominent activist for equal rights to education, her contribution to this cause was born from her own fight against adversity. Trent was born in Zimbabwe (formally Rhodesia) when poverty, war, and traditional women’s roles denied women the opportunity to attend school. She secretly taught herself to read, and later wrote her dreams, which included getting a bachelor’s degree, a master’s, and a PhD. She then sealed them in a tin can and buried them deep in the ground. Despite marrying young and having three children by the time she was eighteen, Trent never lost sight of her dreams. Through hard work and belief in her dreams, she eventually earned multiple degrees, and a prominent global platform with world leaders and international businesses and audiences where she advocates for universal access to quality education. Trent has published two books, won the 2018 NAACP Award for Outstanding Literary Work, and improved education for over 6,000 children. A true inspiration, Trent’s motto is “Tinogona”, which means “It is achievable!” Tall and glorious, Trent’s flower is a beautiful yet durable flame lily. An incredible climbing flower, flame lilies can reach a height of almost 10 feet. As well as being able to rise and thrive in all conditions, flame lilies also share Trent’s home of Zimbabwe where they are the national flower.
