Nairobi â€” City Hall has now introduced digital zebra crossing, aimed at protecting pedestrians from being knocked down by motorists and cyclists. This system is used in developed countries such as United Kingdom and United States of America. County's Minister for Roads and infrastructure Hitan Majevda said this will also bring order and sanity to the roads. "This is a pilot project already we have made eight installations and our aim is to have all the major avenues installed with this system, our aim is to have safe spaces for our pedestrians who have been neglected by the city's transport system," he said. This project could be a solution to the many pedestrian deaths mostly witnessed in Nairobi. Just recently the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) raised a alarm over the increased number of pedestrian deaths and urged pedestrians and motorists to exercise caution while using Nairobi roads. "Pedestrians need to also use the designated crossing points be it foot bridges or zebra crossings," said Majevda. Often, pedestrians have little to protect themselves because even in the set aside walkways you will find public service vehicles and cyclists and hawkers trying to encroach on to the space. Also, drivers view zebra crossing as more like polite suggestions than required stopping zones. How it operates- One is required to press a button, wait until given a green light then cross. On the other hand, it will be red light for motorists who will be required to stop until the pedestrian (s) cross on the other side. If motorists and cyclists cross when it's green light for pedestrians, they risk being arrested and penalized.
