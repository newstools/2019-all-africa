Ghana and Israel will next week team up to hold, in Accra, the maiden edition of an agribusiness, innovation and technology fair dubbed "Ghana Grows with Israel (GHrow-IL) Agritech Summit 2019". The platform would focus on input technologies, modern agronomic practices and financing models in agribusiness and offer participants from both countries an opportunity to build new ties through the agricultural value chain. It would explore opportunities on how Ghana could leverage modern technology to increase agriculture productivity as well as create the linkages to boost Ghana's Planting for Food and Jobs programme. A statement issued by the Israeli Embassy in Accra, on Tuesday, said the event scheduled for Tuesday, June 4, 2019, is expecting 18 leading Israeli Agric-Tech innovators and executives interested in the Ghanaian market expected. It is being organised by the Trade and Economic Mission of Israel in Ghana and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture with other local partners. The statement said the event was inspired by the need to find innovative ways to promote food security which had become a major concern as the world population increased and natural resources dwindled. "This meant that there is an increasing need for smart solutions for more efficient farming, safer food packaging and storage", it emphasised. Since the 1950s, it said Israel had been at the forefront of developing smart agricultural solutions, which had contributed to their economic success, for which reason the summit had been organised to share their expertise.
