Nairobi â€” The Speakers of Kenya and Ukraine say legislators world over have a crucial role in advancing their respective national interests at the international arena. Speaking during a bilateral meeting, Speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi and his counterpart from Ukraine Andriy Parubiy underscored the place of parliamentary engagement in advancing bilateral relations in modern diplomacy. The Speaker added that legislators hold the highest degree of legitimacy as they represent people from all walks of life. The meeting between Muturi and Parubiy also resolved to establish a Kenya-Ukraine Parliamentary Group, as the first step towards enhancing their bilateral relations. The agreement by the respective heads of the two legislatures will enhance Parliamentary collaboration and sharing of experiences about Parliamentary practices and procedures. Parubiy took the opportunity to thank Kenya for her continued stance in recognizing the territorial integrity of Ukraine in the international fora, adding that Ukraine regards Kenya as a strategic partner in her bid to earn a foothold in Africa. Kenya was among the first African countries to establish bilateral relations with Ukraine soon after their independence in 1991. On his part, Muturi reiterated that Kenya respects the statutes of international law and the principle of territorial integrity of other nations. On Parliamentary collaboration, Speaker Muturi also noted that the National Assembly of Kenya would be interested in tapping from their unique budget making process and as well as from Ukraine's progressive taxation regime "Mr Speaker, I have seen an impressive report of the Members of the Budget and Appropriations Committee who in March 2017, visited the Parliament of Ukraine on a study tour, and I hope that the Departmental Committee on Finance and National Planning could undertake a similar tour to study your very progressive taxation regime," Speaker Muturi observed.
