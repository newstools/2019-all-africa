Afro-fusion music singer, Burna Boy has announced his permanent exit from all social media platforms. The singer made the announcement via his Instagram story where he revealed he would be permanently handing over his social media accounts to his management, which would now be strictly used to announce show dates and the promotion of his new music. "I'm leaving all social media platforms permanently. They are now all strictly for my show dates and new music. My social media will now be in the full control of my management. Love and positivity to all. I love you all from the bottom of my heart", he said. This development is coming a few weeks after Davido also announced that he would be going off social media for a month to enable him focus on concluding his forthcoming album. Recall that popular Nigerian songstress, Simi, also once announced that she may have to delete her twitter page so that she can fully concentrate on her music. However, following the 'Killing Dem' crooner's announcement, there are speculations that just like Simi and Davido who failed to stay away from social media after making the announcement, he may also be unable to stay away as planned. Reasons for the social media layoff was not given other than re-emphasizing love for his fans.
