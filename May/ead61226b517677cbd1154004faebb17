Sirisia Member of Parliament, John Waluke, has sensationally blamed ODM leader Raila Odinga for Kenya's failure to get funding from China for the second phase of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR). Last month the Opposition leader accompanied President Uhuru Kenyatta to China to seek funds for the extension of the SGR from Naivasha to Kisumu. Prior to the trip, Mr Odinga had said the Beijing trip would pave way for Sh350bn Kisumu SGR loan and revive the Kisumu inland port whose fortunes have dwindled due to the collapse of the old and dilapidated railway line. However, the high-powered Kenyan delegation failed to convince the Chinese government to loosen their string purse. CHINESE FUNDS But according to the Sirisia legislator, had President Kenyatta made the trip alone, China would have released the funds. "He (Raila) is jinxed. The other day he accompanied President Kenyatta to China to go and seek fund for the SGR. But the Chinese saw his (Raila) face and decided not to give Kenya the funds because they know who is in the habit of uprooting railway lines," Waluke said at public rally on Sunday. The MP also pointed an accusing finger at Mr Odinga for being the one behind calls for a referendum in the country. "Raila takes credit for 2010 Constitution of Kenya, yet he is now busy engineering a referendum to amend the same constitution," Waluke said.
