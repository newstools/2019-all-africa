Chinese mobile phone manufacturer Oppo is set to unveil its Avengers themed edition phones in the Kenyan market on the last weekend of May this year, it has revealed. According to the firm, the Oppo F11 Pro Avengers Limited Edition will land in the country on May 25, 2019, with the pre-orders commencing on Saturday May 18, 2019.

The company's Kenya Communications Manager Muthoni Wachira said the new device capturing all Avengers: Endgame heroes in a casing will complement great reception of the movie by Kenyan fans. "Our focus is to refine our customer's experience with the device" she said. She revealed that its Oppo F11 Pro Marvel Avengers Limited Edition will also be introduced in the country later in the year but in very limited quantities.
