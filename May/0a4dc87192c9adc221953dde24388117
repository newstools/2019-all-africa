Fresh from winning a fourth London Marathon title in a new course record and the second-fastest marathon time on Sunday, Eliud Kipchoge on Monday had a simple request to his fans. The world champion and world record holder over the distance wanted to know what he can do in London before he returns back home and he got more than he had bargained for. Hundreds of people around the globe gave him suggestions and ideas with everyone wanting to spend time with him. "I've got a couple of days left in London, where should I visit?" Kipchoge posed. From javelin champion Julius Yego to Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo to the BBC, suggestions flowed in freely. Some were nice and genuine while others were hilarious and witty. The genuine ones: British museum.
