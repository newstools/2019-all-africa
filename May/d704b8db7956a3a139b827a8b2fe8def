Cape Town â€” One thing I have learnt is never try to make Kenyans on Twitter mad, or else they will tear you to shreds. This is exactly what they did after Netflix, the world's leading entertainment streaming service, introduced Swahili subtitles to its TV and film services. Kenyans were not impressed. They were quick to point out the mistakes and couldn't resist letting their fingers do the talking as many took to Twitter to share views. Check out some of the tweets: @SerahKatusia - If you love to laugh, and comedy isn't working, turn on Netflix's Swahili subtitles ... it will crack you to a magical world and back! ðŸ™‰ðŸ˜‚ @Lizesjay  - My goodness! Swahili subtitles on Netflix are hilarious! Your highness-urefu wako. Did Uganda do this? @PhannieAK -   @netflix  who told you that we need Swahili subtitles? We understand English. We hear it and comprehend it well. Stop this nonsense!!!! Also, you've been getting the translations wrong! @Wairimu_WaGitau Â  - These swahili Netflix subtitles are cool and shit but how many times do I have to put that shit off before they get the fucking memo? @RealestNana -Â  Meanwhile in KENYA....ðŸ˜‚(inaccurate netflix subtitles)Netflix: Are you still watching?Me:(amazed) Yes, all eyes on the screen,... wondering who the hell came up with this SWAHILI SUBTITLES ...... @X_trathoughtful   Dear @netflix. Please take off those horrendous Swahili subtitles. We speak and understand English in Africa. PS: Badass isn't "Punda mbaya" though. Your translators duped you big time. Thank you. @iKeynan - These Netflix Swahili subtitles are just fine. At the end of the day, Netflix is an entertainment content provider. And those subtitles are hella entertaining.
