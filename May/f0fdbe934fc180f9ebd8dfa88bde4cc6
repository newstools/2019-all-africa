Johannesburg â€” INDUSTRY leaders in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) bloc have pledged to explore partnerships to transform the region through information and communications technologies (ICTs). The commitment has been made at the 39th Southern Africa Telecommunications Association (SATA) Annual Conference in Mauritius last week. Mauritius Telecom hosted the event in the capital Port Louis under the theme: "ICT Connectivity and Service Delivery for the Benefit of All: Transforming our Society through Broadband and ICT Development." Directors, managers and senior experts in the ICT industry from various organisations from within and outside the SADC region converged. Andrew Matseke, Broadband Infraco Chief Executive Officer, pledged the company's commitment to partner regional players in driving collaborative efforts to ensure seamless connectivity for the citizens of SADC. "Together with other telcos in the region, we believe we can contribute immensely to the respective governments' goals of ensuring that no citizen is left behind during the ICT revolution that is taking place, also known as 4IR," Matseke said. He said in so doing, the company hoped to drive the cost to communicate down, while empowering diverse peoples in the region (SADC) with new opportunities and skills that would otherwise not be ordinarily available." Broadband Infraco is South Africa's state owned telecommunications company. The annual conference's main objective is to collaborate in setting recommendations and resolutions that will be taken by the region for the new financial year. Phumza Dyani, Broadband Infraco Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, said the conference was important for developing relationships across SADC regional member states, driving region specific imperatives and to agree on acceptable standards. "The imperative to transform lives through ICT is shared across the Region. ICT is seen as a conduit to implementing social change," Dyani said.
